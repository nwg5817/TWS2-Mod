<long_description>\n\nA place of refuge from the burdens of the world, a sanctuary gives the faithful a chance to understand the true meaning of the Buddha’s teachings. A sanctuary can bring an air of contentment to a whole province, and train monks to spread the faith. \n\nMany Buddhist sanctuaries in Japan were built next to older Shinto shrines. In this, Japanese Buddhism was different from many other religious invasions across the world, which tended to build their new buildings on top of the wreckage of the old religion and its shrines. The new would nearly always replace the old, often with the aid of a builder’s mattock. Buddhism, though, was quite content to leave a space for the kami, and even adopt some spirits as tutelary examples for the faithful. The resulting fusion of faiths lasted for hundreds of years, until the Meiji Restoration.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nConstruction of a temple enables the advanced training of monks. The temple itself is a place of solitude and contemplation, the perfect place to consider the world and a man’s place in it. The calming influence of the temple and its adherents spreads far beyond the walls. \n\nEveryone turns to the gods in an hour of need. In the sixth century, when Prince Shotoku of the Soga needed help to banish anti-Buddhist elements from Japan, he called on the fearsome Bishamon to aid him in his efforts. Prince Shotoku’s appeals were apparently answered. Originally the protector of the north, Bishamon became the protector of the law who also guarded people from illness and demons. He was a war god, and was one of the Shichi Fukujin, the seven deities of happiness and good luck. He normally appeared as a blue-faced warrior with a spear and a pagoda representing his dual personality, warrior and monk, but always a protector of the faithful.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe construction of a monastery is a tangible commitment to Buddhism, and it increases the happiness of all people in a province. As might be expected, a monastery is a place of quiet contemplation, removed from the worries of daily life. The monks are free to reach a better understanding of Buddha and his teachings, and to hone their skills as part of their contemplative exercises. \n\nIn the 8th century, Buddhist monasteries were subject to significant interference from the imperial government. Regulations controlled all aspects of monastic life, and religious leaders found themselves acting as bureaucrats rather than contemplating their own spiritual development. Driven from the monasteries to escape such interference, the monks went out into the country and took the teachings of Buddha to the population as a whole. It was not long before new monasteries, free from Imperial and Court control, were founded. It was, however, useful for the monasteries to have patronage from the great families, and to offer religious respectability in return. </long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA great temple serves as a focus for religious devotion and a place of pilgrimage. Its monks are men of enormous faith, entirely devoted to their work. At the heart of such a temple there is often a reliquary, a focus for pilgrims. More usefully, for the temple’s noble sponsors, are the training halls and scholastic facilities that produce learned and enthusiastic monks, eager to spread the word. \n\nThe building style of the earliest Buddhist temples was not particularly Japanese, as they copied Chinese and Korean patterns. Over time these changed to become more distinctively Japanese to cope with the local climate, and to withstand earthquakes. There was also less distinction than might be expected between Buddhist and Shinto buildings. It was not unusual to find that Buddhist temples included Shinto shrines within them, so that the local kami would not be disturbed. Likewise, larger Shinto shrines would have Buddhist temples somewhere within the shrine complex. It was only after the Meiji Restoration in 1868 that a stricter division was introduced into Japanese religious life.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nAll armies need to have somewhere for new recruits to gather and do at least a little training. An encampment can be as simple as a line of tents or have the air of a semi-permanent military town, but it has one purpose: to turn undisciplined and scared civilians into something resembling soldiers. Having one makes it easier and cheaper to recruit units, and to send casualty replacements where they are needed. \n\nEncampments have always allowed commanders to keep their men where they can be watched. Given half a chance, civilians will do their best to separate young men from their money with drink, women and gambling. All of these can cause trouble in the military, particularly as soldiers are often happy to indulge in such pleasurable alternatives to drill and training. Encampments have to be well organised, otherwise illness could sweep through them, and this gives a practical reason for learning the disciplines of a soldierly life. A man who has dug latrines for a few hundred of his comrades is likely to see battle as a pleasant alternative!</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nAn armoury centralises the supply of arms and armour, and guarantees that all equipment will be of a given quality. It is not just a store, but usually includes workshops for craftsmen to repair and create military items. It therefore improves the defensive strength of any unit recruited in the same province. \n\nNearly all armies of the medieval period relied on looting the dead to provide weapons and equipment for the living. Sometimes this was even an organised business. This, however, was discovered by many to be a ramshackle way to run a war. By centralising armour under the control of noble families, they could also introduce a level of uniformity into their armies. A medieval European army would be a riot of colours, liveries and heraldry, while a Japanese army would have a calm uniformity to it. This has a practical benefit for a warrior: anyone not wearing the same armour as you in a battle is almost certainly an enemy!</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nHunting teaches men to fire accurately and quickly against swift-moving targets. To miss is to go hungry or be eaten by something inedible! Therefore, a hunting lodge improves the firing accuracy of missile-armed troops recruited in this province. \n\nArchery has always been about food as well as warfare. An arrow does care whether it strikes a deer or a man. Shooting and stalking skills honed in providing food always transfer to a martial context. The hunter who misses with his first shot usually never gets the chance to take a second one. \n\nDespite their poetic names, the narrow willow-leaf, willow-leaf and dragon’s tongue were all lethally sharp arrow heads designed to kill the target by causing massive bleeding. Anything hit by one of these would soon bleed to death. On the other hand, archers used the blunt, turnip-shaped whistling signal arrows against their targets when dog hunting. This, presumably, allowed them to make it more of a “sport” as each dog would require several hits before it was disabled or killed.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThese proving grounds will improve the attacking strength of any unit trained in the province. An army is more than a collection of individuals, no matter how personally brave they may be. It needs discipline, good order and confidence in its tactics and commanders if it is to work to full effect. This includes an understanding of exactly how its weapons are best used in action. When a unit fights as one, not as a mob, using its weapons properly, its strength is magnified and fully utilised. \n\nEvery soldier needs to understand and trust in the weapons he carries. This is why drill has always been an important part of training. A soldier becomes completely familiar with what he is supposed to be doing, without even the need for conscious thought. He also comes to grasp the full potential of the weapons he has been given by his commanders. Practice does pay off in combat: men trained to fight together will always be better than a mass of individuals each seeking their own petty glory.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nBushi training grounds allow the recruitment of basic sword- and bow-armed troops.\n\nThe way of the warrior, later called bushido, lay at the heart of everything that a samurai could be, or hoped to become. While a samurai was expected to be a master of sword and bow, there was a moral element to his training as well, a core set of ethics that guided his life in every waking minute. More than just a code of chivalry or a set of martial arts for using weapons with surpassing skill, bushido was a guide to living and dying with honour. It was the “dying” part that made bushido different from many other warrior systems: death had no bearing on whether a course of action could be considered failure. The only failure was not to carry through an action when it was the right thing to do as a warrior. </long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThis school allows the training of samurai infantry, and improves the expertise of other bushi (warriors). \n\nLong years of training are required to understand the way of the warrior, and to train mind and muscles to the point where a stroke or shot can be made without conscious thought. A warrior needs to empty his mind of everything – even, or perhaps especially, fear, hope and anger – if he is to fight to his full potential. The thousands of hours spent with sword and bow empty the man of everything except the need to perform the perfect act. In that moment of still perfection, he can defeat any opponent without considering anything other than victory. Such training is necessary, but expensive for the warlord who wants his men to be the best.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThis dojo allows the training of mounted samurai, and reduces the time needed to train all sword- and bow-armed samurai and attendant troops. \n\nNearly every warrior culture on the Eurasian landmass defined its warrior elite as fighters on horseback. The word for “cavalryman” is often synonymous with a ruling, higher social caste within a society. They quite literally look down on the peasants. This is not surprising: apart from anything else, the expense of buying and owning a horse meant than anyone who had a warhorse was, by definition, an important man in the community. \n\nThe samurai began as mounted warriors. As a child, a samurai was put in the saddle almost as soon as he could walk. His weapons training emphasised battle from horseback, although the earliest samurai fought as mounted bowmen, using their horses to move swiftly away from any threat before returning to harass their enemies once again. Early samurai armour, for example, is perfect for this fighting style; it will keep out arrows rather effectively, but not sword cuts.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThis legendary dojo allows the training of samurai heroes, and greatly increases the experience of other units trained here. The quality of instruction is second to none. \n\nSamurai warfare was, at least initially, an affair of individuals who acted independently on the battlefield. Men would advance towards their enemies, calling out their names and achievements in the hopes of finding a worthy opponent to fight. This kind of affair is not so much a battle as a massive series of duels between brave men. A warrior tagged the head of his slain enemy, and these were displayed after the battle to determine each man’s contribution to victory. It was, by the way, a very bad idea to take the head of a friend in the confusion of battle. However, the idea of individual heroism is a powerful one, and one that the way of the warrior embodied in many ways. Every warrior on the battlefield would regard a truly heroic warrior, even an enemy, with admiration.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA town allows an extra specialist building to be constructed. New buildings increase the value of a province through, for example, trade, or allow a greater selection of troops to be recruited. \n\nThere was a certain ambiguity in the attitude of Japanese society to the idea of towns. It was nice to have somewhere with a veneer of civilized living, but there were the people who lived in towns as well. Chonin, or townsmen, were a class that included merchants and many craftsmen not directly tied to agricultural production. While there was a certain back-breaking respectability to being a member of the peasantry, the chonin had a slightly lower status. However they earned their livings, it certainly wasn’t by honest graft in the fields. Wise rulers, however, recognised that towns were vitally important to their provinces, and could be a source of considerable pride as they grew and, hopefully, flourished. It was only in a good size town that certain skilled craftsmen, goldsmiths, say, would ever find enough customers to be able to survive.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA stronghold is a sign to the peasants of exactly who is in charge of their lives, a reminder of where loyalties should lie, and obeisance be made. It is a good base for the troops of the local garrison, enabling them to keep order in the surrounding province, and attract new recruits to their cause. Although not expected to hold out for long when besieged, a stronghold can act as a stumbling block for any invader. \n\nJapanese fortifications always had to be built to meet two conflicting priorities. Firstly, there was the obvious need to be a defensive structure that kept out enemies and was sufficiently impressive to keep the locals awed. Secondly, Japanese castles and strongholds had to survive earthquakes, a problem that most of the rest of the world did not have to consider. Japan sits on top of one of the most geologically active areas in the world, and castles could not be lumpen, monolithic structures if they were to survive a quake.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThis solid structure can be garrisoned to defend a province and slow down invaders, even though it will not withstand a prolonged siege. No attacking general, however, would sensibly leave troops at his rear as he advances into enemy territory. A fort therefore costs time to reduce, a precious commodity in warfare. It also reminds the local peasantry of their overlord’s power, and helps that lord recruit new troops. \n\nEarly Japanese fortifications were usually very practical structures, made from wood and without layered defences of walls and towers. They were intended to draw in and delay attackers rather than withstand them. Early castles were located on rivers, at ports and at other important strategic chokepoints. The builders always took full advantage of the natural landscape: mountainous positions were favoured, and nearby streams were diverted to become as moats where possible. It was common for the defenders to not lurk behind their walls when attacked: the defenders would, more often than not, sally forth to meet the enemy rather than rely on the walls. If the attackers tried to bypass the castle, the defenders would not sit idly behind their walls, but would instead raid supply lines and harass the invaders until they either retreated, or decided to take the fort.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA castle is a sign of absolute ownership, stamped onto the landscape like a family seal, documenting power. It is a strong defence against enemy incursions, and a centre for administration within a province. With such an impressive structure looming over their homes, people feel secure, but they also understand that they must keep to their allotted stations in life. It also allows the province to develop further with new building. \n\nA castle was not only a military fixture in the life of a noble family, even though it was cunningly designed to make it as difficult to take as possible. It was also a celebration of their status and wealth. The effort of building and maintaining even one castle was almost crippling, so it became public statement of confidence, power and good taste. Beautiful craftsmanship and luxurious details made life in a castle anything but austere for the nobles. Such quiet ostentation also served to ram home the point that the owners were not to be trifled with, or ignored. </long_description>

It also provides entertainments for the nobility and gentry, and shirabyoshi are trained there. \n\nAlmost regardless of time and place in human history, powerful men have made a point of controlling large tracts of land, often depriving farmers of ownership in the process. Before the arrival of industry, and without craftsmen working in large groups, land and wealth were inextricably linked. A lord’s landholding defined his status with his peers, his underlings, and at the Imperial Court; enough land and enough wealth could even overcome any doubts or uncertainties about family or personal honour. </long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA mandokoro gives the owning family more influence, and a better tax effect. \n\nLaw and order are important in any stratified and authoritarian society. Everyone has to know their place in the system, and the penalties for transgression. It is a practical solution to the problem of having many people live in a relatively small space, if not very attractive to those at the bottom of the social heap. In this, Japan was no different to many other parts of the world in the medieval period. “Social mobility” or moving from one social class to another was almost completely unknown. A man would be born, live and die a samurai, peasant or townsman. He could fall into poverty as a samurai and be unable to earn a living because it was socially beneath him, or rise to tremendous riches as a townsman, and remain lower in the social pecking order than the humblest peasant. The law, however, existed to protect those who behaved themselves and stayed within the bounds of acceptability.</long_description>

Additionally, shirabyoshi trained in this province are more experienced, simply because they have such a demanding audience to satisfy at the palace. \n\nHistorically, the Fujiwara survived the various disturbances of the Imperial order and the Gempei War, but their influence was greatly reduced. In-fighting among the Fujiwara themselves almost certainly hadn’t helped their cause. They kept some Court positions, but the rise of the Minamoto and the establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate made these positions honorary rather than useful. They did, however, indirectly get a taste of power because the fourth and fifth Kamakura Shoguns were members of the Kujo clan, a branch of the Fujiwara.</long_description>

The struggle was indeed fierce, but with the final and catastrophic defeat of the Taira at the Battle of Dan-no-ura, the Minamoto instituted a new period of military rule in the Emperor’s name: the Kamakura Shogunate. The last Minamoto Shogun was assassinated in 1219, so their triumph was not long lived.</long_description>

Arrogance, understandable perhaps, and excessive ambition eventually brought a reaction from the other great families. The Taira were usually outmatched in battle, even with the person of the Emperor to inspire their warriors. Eventually, most of the Taira drowned at the Battle of Dan-no-ura; those who were aboard ships not sunk by enemy action threw themselves into the sea, along with the six-year-old Emperor Antoku. The Taira also attempted to throw the Imperial regalia into the deeps, and may even have done so with the sword and the mirror, although these may have been ceremonial copies rather than the originals given that the regalia is still in use today. The remaining Taira were executed.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA barter exchange allows farmers, fishermen, traders, indeed anyone, to swap goods they produce for other items they need. It improves the wealth of a province because people can specialise and become experts if they can swap their surplus for someone else’s surplus. If, for example, a farmer can barter he can spend all his time farming, rather than wasting time trying to be an indifferent weaver. \n\nBarter is probably the oldest and most universal form of trade in the world. Anyone can understand the simple idea of swapping one thing, or pile of things, for another. Anyone with a surplus of something can become “richer” by trading that surplus away for other goods: his new possessions are his for less overall effort than if he had made them himself.  It is, however, quite difficult to calculate fractional values for goods, or to organise complicated swaps involving more than a couple of goods or traders. Trade in kind is a very simple “spot market”, and really rather hard to tax in a practical way. Is a tax of a bag of grain the same as taking a goat, a chicken or a bullock? And where does the taxman keep all these chickens and rice bags he has taxed?</long_description>

No more food is grown, but less of what is produced is lost in storage. \n\nIn the medieval world, including Japan, the harvest was the vitally important time of year. Only the very brave or the very thoughtless campaigned when there was a harvest to be gathered in. The amount of food gathered and then stored over winter determined exactly how many people would be alive come spring. Even then, poor storage conditions could result in the crop mouldering away in damp conditions. In a good year, everyone in a village would have enough to eat. A bad year, either because of poor weather or, worse still, rapacious bandits or the lord’s tax collectors, would mean starvation and death. The elderly and the children would be the first to die, then the weak  and sick among the adults. Even the lord in his castle could feel the pinch of hunger in his belly if the crop failed.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA market adds substantially to a province’s taxable wealth. A market has cash in circulation: there are prices, often controlled by the lord, expressed in monetary terms, not in the number of chickens that must be swapped for so many rice sacks. Once people can sell their surplus, they will always seek out goods to buy, and that can add substantially to the economic activity in a province. \n\nDespite the need for trade, the activity was considered rather improper in medieval Japan. Merchants, like many townsmen, had a lower status than hardworking peasants. Whatever the merchants were doing to earn a living, it was obviously not quite as honest or straightforward. And, despite the fact that the nobles enjoyed spending the taxes they gathered, they certainly considered trade to be utterly beneath any proper gentleman. Merchants and cash have their uses, though: it is easier to transport wealth around in the form of coin and treasure than as rice sacks!</long_description>

Once there is a reasonable degree of certainty that people will be able to eat tomorrow, the next day, next week and beyond, they can start planning for a future, and working towards it.

It is also possible to create enough of a food surplus so that it can be traded, bringing wealth into the province and making people’s lives better in that way.

After all, it is fair that the merchants, with so much to protect, should end up paying a substantial amount for their safety. \n\nGuilds were often granted trade concessions in return for knowing their place in the scheme of things, and paying their taxes promptly. While merchants could become extremely rich, socially they were regarded as being lower than humble peasants: they did not labour honestly in the fields to feed people, but somehow made money in unnamed, but undoubtedly unsavoury, ways. It was, of course, completely beneath any warrior to actually work for a living, so merchants and other townsfolk remained an unfortunate necessity.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nFields physically organise the work of villages, making sure that everyone has enough good land for their crops. \n\nAgriculture is one of the oldest organised human practices. However, subsistence farming means everyone has to work hard just to have enough to eat. A field system allows a little more sophistication in the way that food is produced. Land can be left fallow, to recover its fertility, on an organised basis; or different crops can be planted each year to maintain the goodness of the soil. None of this organised activity is possible without a system of fields, and the extra food grown allows people to spend their lives on activities other than farming. It is only when there is a food surplus that potters, smiths, weavers, and a host of other craftsmen can live. A food surplus also means enough for valuable bureaucrats and important tax collectors to eat.</long_description>

There is, however, the satisfaction of a slightly fuller belly in most years, and a slightly more varied diet. Dry fields crops include soybeans and other crops depending on the climate. This might only seem like a small improvement in farming methods, but the steady accumulation of such changes makes a huge difference to the lives of ordinary people, the amount of food available, and to the general economic activity of an area. The more food there is, the more time there is for skilled craftsmen to ply their trades.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nHorses are vital to samurai warfare, and strong, brave animals are preferred as mounts. Samurai are horsemen, by tradition mounted archers first and foremost. The ability to ride is as important as any skill at arms. \n\nIt was only during the Sengoku Jidai period that samurai habitually fought as infantry. For much of history “samurai” was a term synonymous with “cavalry” to the Japanese. A samurai was expected to fire his bow accurately from horseback. Given that shooting needed two hands, and the samurai had to stand up in the stirrups, this required the horse and rider to be superbly trained, as the man would have to control his mount only with his knees. A good horse, then, was highly sought after and highly prized. Not only did it have to be tractable and obedient, it also had to be quite hardy to survive on campaign. It is little wonder that horses were prized possessions, just as much as good armour.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nHorse breeders improve the quality of cavalry trained in this province. Improving the horse stock leads to better mounts for all cavalry. \n\nMounted combat defined the early samurai, and good horses were naturally valued for their stamina, strength and courage: a warhorse had to be tough as its rider to survive a campaign season, and not flinch from the stress of battle. They also required nearly as much training as the men. A mounted cavalryman had to control his mount, at the gallop, using only his knees so that his hands were free to use a bow. In turn, this required the horse to have spent just as much time being taught to obey absolutely and precisely. Good horses were therefore valued for their potential offspring as well as their immediate use.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nPaddies are artificially flooded fields where rice is grown. Rice is the staple of all Japanese people, from the lowly peasant harvesting the crop to the mightiest lord enjoying his dinner in exquisite luxury. Even taxes are measured and collected in koku, or measures, of rice. Each province’s basic wealth and therefore potential tax yield is determined by its rice output. \n\nThe unit of tax, the koku, was defined as the amount of rice needed to feed one man for one year. For a lord, then, a koku taken in tax directly represented one basic soldier added to his army; higher ranks would be paid the equivalent of many koku for their services. That it was possible to collect enough surplus rice to support large armies is a tribute to the efficiency of Japanese farmers over many centuries. Starvation was always a harvest away, but it was not as regular or as severe as in, say Europe, during the same period. Relatively speaking, Japanese farmers were far more productive in their work. The constant demand of rice to be paid as taxes, however, could be a terrible burden in lean years but the disloyalty of not paying tax could kill as surely as hunger.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nGood farmers always try to get the most of the land that they are working. By using water cleverly, and making sure that it is not wasted, marginal land can be cultivated, effectively increasing the size and effectiveness of farms. The end result is that a province will produce more food and wealth. \n\nJapan is a very, very hilly country. It was also densely wooded, and that left little good flat land for food production. By cleverly diverting streams, and using terraced paddy fields, almost every patch of ground in Japan that could be used for growing food was eventually cultivated. The result was a very large, relatively well fed population by medieval standards. There were probably more people in Japan at the time of the Gempei War than in the whole of western Europe.</long_description>

They also need a great deal of space if they are to be healthy and content. In medieval Japan this second requirement was something of a problem. A warlord who had an impressive stable of horses was not only demonstrating his military power, but he was also showing the world that money was no object to his ambitions. Stables and studs need good land and that, in Japan, has always been at a premium. The man who could afford to turn productive farmland into luxurious accommodation for his horses really was rich, important and going to impress his neighbours.</long_description>

It also allows the more efficient administration of an area, meaning that more units can be recruited at the same time, and acts as a base for law enforcement. \n\nBefore the Gempei War, central authority in Japan was not strong. Individual provincial governors had every reason to keep an eye on their people, watching for signs of unrest: trouble could always be used by a jealous rival to oust a ruling family. The correct relationships between different classes in society also had to be maintained, and this is where the very public presence of an inspector, or junsatsushi, could be very useful. He alone could make sure that malcontents stayed silent.</long_description>

This also helps with sending replenishment troops to understrength units. \n\nA town watch traditionally keeps the lower classes in order and watches for fires. It is also an excellent training for warriors: they learn to obey orders as well as fight. At the very least, the town watch learn such military skills as obedience, how to form ranks, stand to arms, and prepare to receive an attack. All of these are useful: if men do not act as a well-ordered unit, they will die as a disorganised mob. They may well kill many of the enemy as they die, but they will act ineffectively, not as a piece of the whole army and adding to its collective strength.</long_description>

Peasants also could not be used for offensive actions, or sent away from their homes. At best, they could swell the numbers in an army, or the enemy would get tired out killing them before reaching the real defenders. This sounds harsh, but it was a foolish lord who allowed his entire population of strapping peasants to be slaughtered in battle. If this happened, who would gather the harvest?</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA barracks separates soldiers from the general populace, making it easier to train them and instil discipline, if only because civilians have funny ideas about deciding things for themselves. Ordinary men can be drilled and moulded into fighting warriors away from the comforts and distractions of any kind of home life. As well as recruiting new units, replacements for existing units can also be efficiently mustered and despatched to where they are needed. \n\nEvery organised army in history does its best to keep its soldiers away from civilians, if only to keep desertion, drunkenness and debauchery at manageable levels! Even though life as a soldier is harsh, and never harsher than during training, it is often better than a life spent labouring in the fields. The work is hard, but then so is farming, and there is probably more chance that the new soldier, rather than the farmer, enjoys a hot meal at the end of his labours. There is danger, but then the same is true of working the land. A soldier, though, unlike the peasant, has a chance of making his fortune and changing his fate.</long_description>

Those who are disloyal will have to face any invaders alone, and armed only with whatever implements they can find on their farms.

An arsenal is often a substantial investment for any warlord, if only for the enormous quantities of armour and weapons stored there.

<long_description>\n\nThe kondeidokoro fulfils two functions. Firstly, it acts as a military post, a rallying point for the many local militia who can be called into service to defend their home province. Secondly, it is a clear sign to all that the local lord and his agents are watching, all the time, and it significantly increases repression in a province. It also boosts the experience of any junsatsushi trained there. \n\nThe need for people to behave themselves was always paramount in Japan: there simply wasn’t the room for troublemakers, or the opportunity to send them abroad to cause trouble for someone else. This had been the European solution: open up new lands, or invade someone. At the time of the Gempei War neither plan was an option for the Japanese, as almost every usable bit of land in Japan was already being used for something, and the nearest neighbours were China and Korea. A rigid social system was therefore a practical solution to having so many people needing to live together.</long_description>

Improved transport links also help the replenishment rate for army casualties. All comings and goings are carefully watched, of course, by officials and paid informers, meaning that line of sight is also better along roads. \n\nWhile roads improve the ability of people to move around this was not always what the great families wanted. It was one thing to be able to move an army swiftly, but quite another to have peasants be able to move around freely. Land without workers was, and is, entirely worthless. It generates no taxable income. If the peasants could simply leave, they might just do so! Traders, being people who did not work the land, were free to use them, because they were considered to be worth less than useful, hard working peasants.</long_description>

Because roads and travellers are quite closely watched and monitored, they also improve line of sight and the chance of spotting a rival’s nefarious agents. Travellers can only use them if they have the proper written authorisations. \n\nPost stations were roughly a day’s travel apart, and were supposed to be used by official travellers, offering rest and remounts as required. Because everyone had to report to the stations, it was relatively easy for provincial authorities to keep an eye on who was using the roads, and whether or not they could justify their journeys. Innkeepers, on the other hand, soon realised that where there were weary travellers there was a profit to be made. Historically, the close monitoring roads by central government only came about under the Tokugawa Shogunate, but from the first, only very foolish provincial lords would allow anyone to tramp across their domains.</long_description>

They were entirely military in origin: to make sure he could get armies anywhere, quickly. While this was a sensible way of controlling the country, it had the added benefit of improving internal trade. The roads were so sensibly surveyed that the same routes are still in use today.</long_description>

Without books, ideas are lost as men die; an idea written down has more power than any sword. A calligraphy school creates the scribes that are needed to record everything that occurs in a lord’s domain. Thinkers need to record their thoughts, and these can then be widely promulgated. \n\nFine calligraphy is one of the arts that Japan has made its own. A written language that is based on ideograms rather than an alphabet almost demands that scribes produce beautiful texts just as artistic achievements. The act of writing became an act of meditation, and the artistic sincerity and beauty of the finished product only added to the meaning of a document. The recipient of a message could easily be swayed by the perfection of the calligraphy, as much as by what the document actually said. It was respectful to the reader, not to mention honourable, for the writer to put his heart and soul into his skilled calligraphy. </long_description>

The challenging of older ideas may not always be encouraged, but in such an atmosphere of learning, development of the arts proceeds apace. \n\nThe ideas of Confucius (551 - 478BC) were hugely influential across Asia, including Japan. Confucius valued education as a way of bettering people and society, and his ideas encouraged a meritocratic approach to education. Those who could learn should learn as far Confucian philosophy was concerned. At the same time, the growth of Japanese Imperial influence required more courtiers and administrators: these men had to be educated to a high standard if they were going to be capable of doing their jobs.

Confucian teachings are, at heart, optimistic and humane, holding that men can be taught and made better by their own efforts. There is an emphasis on honesty and righteousness, at all levels of society, and towards all others in society. Confucianism holds that a ruler should act correctly towards his subjects; in turn the social elite were expected to behave with benevolence and to set a good example for the rest of society. It is not particularly egalitarian, but then such an idea would probably have been inconceivable at the time. Confucianism did, however, have an appeal across much of Asia, including Japan; its emphasis on righteousness and honesty meshed with much of the best elements of the samurai ethos in bushido.</long_description>

The naginata is a long weapon, and it is advisable to stand well away from any trainee swinging it with gusto! \n\nThe weapon itself can be used as a spear or as a cutting blade, but it requires considerable strength as well as skill. \n\nThe origins of the naginata are obscured by time. It may have developed from an agricultural implement like the English mediaeval bill developed from the farming billhook but, given its association with the samurai this seems unlikely. Samurai were gentlemen, not farmers. It is more likely that the weapon is a Japanese reinterpretation and refinement of a traditional Chinese glaive, the “yan yue dao”, which translates as the rather poetic term “reclining moon blade”. This does, however, quite clearly describe the shape of the business end of the weapon. The Japanese naginata’s blade is slightly straighter and closer to a sword in overall form.</long_description>

After all, any fool can swing a staff or club. The weapon seems to have come into relatively common usage for samurai and sohei during the Gempei War itself. The association with warrior monks was not always accurate, but became a convention of artistic depictions of monks in battle. Japanese artists even drew the weapon being carried by monks who had probably never even seen a naginata, let alone held one. This, however, was to emphasize the martial tradition of monks, who were far from being quiet contemplative types like their Christian contemporaries.</long_description>

Naginatajutsu still requires skill, of course, and a good deal of courage to face an equally-skilled opponent armed with a practice naginata. Koryu, on the other hand, probably translates best as “old school”, and it is likely the techniques taught for battle with the naginata were different from today's kata. If nothing else, koryu would be entirely concerned with the practical business of chopping an opponent into quivering chunks, rather than trying to show proper form and impress tournament judges.</long_description>

He is also credited as a cunning fighter, and is supposed to have collected 999 swords from his defeated opponents, a number that looks suspiciously convenient when telling a good yarn! He is also credited with defending the bridge during the Battle of Koromo River, giving Minamoto no Yoshitsune enough time to commit suicide with dignity. Benkei’s death was suitably heroic: the enemy were too scared to approach the huge monk, and then realised that he wasn’t moving.

A coastal village is also a good foundation for all sea-related activities as they are often placed on natural harbours or in sheltered inlets. They provide work and income in a province and can be expanded later. \n\nFishermen and farmers were not quite at the bottom of the social structure in medieval Japan. They were vital if everyone, even the mightiest lord, was going to eat, and had status as a result. They were, however, tied by a hereditary principle that linked social status and employment. Jobs were passed from father to son, and there was little chance of “bettering yourself”. Europe had sumptuary laws that limited what people could wear according to social position, but the Japanese discouraged rising above one’s station in life by copying any aspect of a higher social class. It was equally unthinkable for higher status individuals to get their hands dirty with manual labour, such as fishing.</long_description>

Sea battles never really evolved beyond boarding actions, but this did give Japan an advantage when it came to piracy. Booty and loot are no use at all at the bottom of the sea. Japan developed both a pirate tradition and a pirate problem. Japanese pirates were the bane of Chinese coastal shipping for centuries, something that bothered the central and provincial governments not one jot. This provoked severe reprisals from the Chinese from time to time, but without ever solving the piracy issue. There was simply too much money to be made as a pirate. As always happens, some pirates eventually managed to become rich enough that they were seen as respectable. Gold washed away all sins in the end, and remade the pirates as “sea lords”. </long_description>

Rather than attacking a an enemy ship’s structure with large weapons, Japanese ships acted as floating platforms for boarding actions. The crew were the targets of any attacks. The intention in any naval engagement was always to close with the enemy, grapple, and then fight a land battle across the lashed-together ships. This meant that a relatively large crew of soldiers was required, resulting in horrendous casualties in most naval engagements. The losing side simply could not run away from a sea battle; what few prisoners were taken would often be tossed overboard at the end of the battle, or the losers would throw themselves into the sea. This happened at the decisive Battle of Dan-no-ura in 1185, that brought the Gempei War to a close.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA drydock is a basin that can be drained for shipbuilding work, and then flooded when a vessel is completed. This allows very large ships to be built safely and then gently floated out when complete. The process of draining and flooding the dock is dependent upon the tides, with lock gates being left open at particularly low tides, and then closed just as the tide turns. This minimises the work to get any remaining water out of the dock. Although slow and cumbersome to operate, a drydock lets shipwrights construct and repair the most powerful vessels invented to date. \n\nHistorically, it was not until the Sengoku Jidai that the Japanese started building large warships, and even then not for any national fleet. Most Japanese vessels resembled nothing so much as floating castles, probably because of a lack of credible long range anti-ship weaponry such as cannons. Instead, Japanese naval battles nearly always came to be large scale boarding actions, where individual valour and aggression mattered more than seamanship. Unfortunately, this also meant that casualties in naval battles tended to be severe, as ship’s crews often had little choice but to fight to the death.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe state academy allows the training of many scholars and Imperial bureaucrats. While this is a worthy thing in itself, it is not the whole story. The masters and students also add significantly to the cultural and intellectual attainments of the whole country. Philosophy, the arts, and more practical thinking can flourish here. \n\nConfucianism sees all education as a good thing for all people, and this idea was adopted by the Japanese. Indeed, from an early point in Japanese history a samurai was expected to be a Confucian “gentleman” as well as a warrior: the idea of “pen and sword in accord” was not just a pretty, poetical metaphor. It was meant to be exactly what it said. A samurai should be able to express his thoughts with a calligraphy brush as readily as he could dismember an opponent with his sword. A clear head and a steady hand were useful in peace and war, at home and on the battlefield. The great families of the Gempei War certainly valued educated cunning as much as swordsmanship as they manoeuvred for power at Court.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe ability to shoot accurately should be prized in all archers, but it requires training and dedication to achieve. An archery range allows basic archery to be taught, and bow-armed units to be recruited. It does not, however, teach the advanced skills of archery: it is sufficient here to hit the target and do so in the proper manner. Combat will teach men how to keep firing when under threat!\n\nThe bow was not solely used for war. Recreational archery and hunting played an important part in the art. The bow itself was a beautiful and complicated piece of equipment, with an unusual asymmetric shape: the grip was well below the mid-point. This unusual design came about because horse archery was the first skill of all samurai: a bow with the grip in the middle would have been completely unmanageable on horseback and become entangled in the saddle furniture. The short lower section meant it could be swung over the horse’s neck and back quickly. The bow itself was a composite, made of bamboo, wood and leather and was often much taller than the user. The design was extremely strong, and it was not uncommon for bow strings to snap under the strain of being fired.

<long_description>\n\nThis range allows the training and recruitment of more advanced and skilful bow-armed units. In times of warfare the single archer must use his strength in company. Knowing how to use a bow requires refinement if it is to be used as an effective weapon of war. There are the extra skills of releasing volleys and reloading at speed as part of a group to learn and, hopefully, master.\n\nAs warfare grew in scale and ferocity, it was no longer enough for individual samurai to fight singly and in search of personal glory and honour. Larger, and cheaper, forces were needed too. Although the bow had been a traditional samurai weapon, and jealously guarded as such, it became sensible to train common ashigaru to use it effectively. They would fire massive volleys at the enemy, rather than try to pick off targets. Arrow bearers would accompany them into battle to carry the huge numbers of arrows required by these tactics. It was also their job, as explained in the “Zohyo Monogatari” written in 1649, to pick up enemy arrows and make sure they were used again! Even after the introduction and use of the arquebus by ashigaru, archers remained an important component of Japanese armies because they could unleash more destruction in a given time than the same number of gunners.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Archery_3_Bow_Master_Dojo_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nAll archers trained at a master dojo have a high level of expertise thanks to their superb teachers. A true master is always willing to share his understanding with his pupils, as their skills add to his honour and reputation. When men learn from the best, they cannot help but reach levels of skill that they might have thought impossible. \n\nThe bow, or yumi, required a great deal of care if it was to work properly and reliably on the battlefield. Indeed, a yumi was considered to have part of its maker within it, and was therefore worthy of respect. Ideally, according to the masters, a bowman should treat his bow with the same kind of care as he would treat himself: it should not be left in the cold, or wet, or excessive heat. A lack of care weakened and warped the weapon, thanks mostly to its composite construction from many different materials. The different elements needed to work in harmony, not against each other. A bow was also under tremendous tension when in use; unstrung, it would actually curve the other way! It was not considered a bad thing to leave a bow relaxed in such a fashion, but it was extremely bad form to use or even touch another man’s bow without his permission. </long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA master will always train the finest students to a pitch little short of perfection. Here, kyudo, the art of the bow, has been brought to a point where the seemingly impossible is attainable. This famous school allows the training and recruitment of elite archer units, including hero units. \n\nJapanese history often shades into legend where feats of arms are concerned. The famous archer Minamoto Tametomo is credited with sinking a ship using a single arrow, and it was reputed that his bow arm was significantly longer than the other as a result of his constant practice. Unfortunately, he came to a tragic end: he was trapped and captured by the Taira clan, who cut the tendons in his arm so that he could no longer hold a bow. Unable to fight on, or ever use his beloved bow again, Tametomo committed suicide. Some think that his death may be the first recorded example of suicide by seppuku.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nConstruction of a temple enables the training of monks. These Buddhist agents can spread the faith, or comfort and inspire believers; they can also spread revolt and despair among enemies. The temple itself is a place of solitude and contemplation, the perfect place to consider the world and a man’s place in it. \n\nEveryone turns to the gods in their hour of need. In the sixth century, when Prince Shotoku of the Soga needed help to banish anti-Buddhist elements from Japan, he called on the fearsome Bishamon to aid him in his efforts. Originally the protector of the north, Bishamon became the protector of the law who guarded people from illness and demons. He was also worshipped as a war god, and was one of the Shichi Fukujin, the seven deities of happiness and good luck. He normally appeared as a blue-faced warrior with a spear and a pagoda. These items represented his dual personality, half warrior, half monk, but always a protector of the faithful.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe construction of a monastery is a tangible commitment to Buddhism, and it increases the happiness of all Buddhists in a province, although Christians will feel some resentment. The monastery also helps to convert non-Buddhists to the faith. As might be expected, a monastery is a place of quiet contemplation, removed from the worries of daily life. The monks are free to reach a better understanding of Buddha and his teachings. \n\nIn the 8th century, Buddhist monasteries were subject to significant interference from the Japanese government. Regulations controlled all aspects of monastic life, and religious leaders found themselves acting as bureaucrats rather than contemplating their own spiritual development. Driven from the monasteries to escape such interference, the monks went out in the country and took the teachings of Buddha to the population as a whole. It was not long before new monasteries, free from government control, were founded. The introduction of Zen in the 12th century saw an upsurge in those seeking to retire from the world and become monks but, as Pure Land Buddhism was promulgated, monasteries went into decline. Pure Land Buddhism reduced the importance of meditation, making it less vital to withdraw from the world.</long_description>

No one in the province can fail to be moved by the spirituality of the place. Each building in the complex is carefully constructed to meet the religious needs of its occupants. In turn, this helps to increase the happiness of all Buddhists in the province and allows the recruitment of new units.\n\nTemples played an important role in Japan, as many great advances happened within their walls and many great people sheltered in them, away from the dangers and troubles of daily life. Some great men chose temples as their final resting places: the remains of Oda Nobunaga, the unifier of Japan, rest at Daitokuji, in the Murasakino section of Kyoto. A little earlier, this temple had been home to Sen no Rikyu (1522-1591), the man who is credited with the development of the tea ceremony. He built tearooms and gardens within Daitokuji to continue the cultural development of the temple, and encouraged his brothers to devote themselves to mastery of the tea ceremony. It came to embody the key principles of Zen, and became popular with the mighty Shoguns of Japan. A man who could perform the tea ceremony was a formidable individual indeed. </long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThis awesome temple increases the happiness of all Buddhists in a province. It also increases the rate at which converts flock to the faith. The monks of this complex are especially blessed and worthy, and demonstrate considerable expertise. The whole is a magnificent act of faith, given solid form.\n\nMount Koya, in Kii province, is home to a monastic complex that even the most vicious of daimyo feared to desecrate. Toyotomi Hideyoshi came close to destroying the temples when the monks chose to support Tokugawa Ieyasu, his great rival, but even he feared the power of the place. When he visited, he was cautious enough to cross the third bridge leading to Kobo Daishi’s tomb during the night before his official visit. Legend has it that no man with morals that Kobo Daishi would find unacceptable could cross the bridge and live. Hideyoshi’s caution paid off, and he was not struck dead. On the following day, Toyotomi Hideyoshi repeated his crossing, now certain that he would survive in public as well. Perhaps he had reason to worry: the tomb of Akechi Mitsuhide, the usurper who rebelled against Oda Nobunaga, on Mount Koya was struck by lightning, perhaps as a warning to others to live and die in a moral and honourable way!</long_description>

<key>SHO_Buff_1_Encampment_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nAll warriors need somewhere to be gathered during recruitment, and somewhere to live whilst they are being trained. An encampment can have the air of a permanent military town, with bustle and apparent confusion all around. It does, however, make it easier and cheaper to recruit new units and organise regular drafts of replacements for existing units.\n\nEncampments had to be well organised, otherwise so many people in close proximity to each other would not stay healthy for long. The discipline of camp life had a secondary benefit - it was always wise for rulers to keep their fighting men separate from troublesome civilians. Apart from anything else, civilians have at least one awkward idea: they like to make a profit from bored soldiers through drink, women and gambling. Most soldiers are entirely happy to go along with these schemes, but discipline can suffer as a result. During the Sengoku Jidai, the number of ashigaru in all armies grew (no clan dared be left behind with a numerically small army) but recruiting commoners meant an inevitable departure from the high disciplinary standards of the samurai, with their code of bushido. </long_description>

<key>SHO_Buff_2_Armoury_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nThis store of arms and armour is an important investment by a clan. By purchasing arms and armour in large quantities, the clan’s warmasters have leverage with their suppliers. Because they are spending a lot of money they can insist on good quality items, and not just take anything and everything that is produced. An armoury, therefore, improves the armour rating of any unit recruited in the province. \n\nIt was not unusual for ashigaru to take weapons from the dead after a battle. All kinds of weaponry would end up in use by commoners, including some rather excellent blades that had once belonged to samurai families. However, during the Sengoku Jidai it became obvious that such informal arrangements were not enough when thousands of ashigaru troops had to be equipped. The various clans took pains to issue standardised arms and armour to their troops, for both protection and recognition purposes. Armour was usually painted or stained in clan colours, and prominently displayed the clan mon, or heraldic symbol, on the breastplate. Standardised equipment was only standard to the issuing clan: each clan had its own preferences over such matters as spear length, and even helmet shape! The enormously tall Date clan gold dress helmets were, perhaps, the most extreme items issued.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Buff_2_Barracks_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nA permanent barracks can give soldiers a home throughout the year, including living space, training areas and all the stores required for their equipment and movables. By keeping warriors in barracks, it is easier to instil discipline and solidarity with the group. They can be kept away from the distractions of the civilian world. A barracks, therefore, makes it much easier to organise recruiting efforts, keep the recruits in order, and either assign them to new units or send them to an army as replacements for the dead. \n\nAll armies across the world have always needed to keep their soldiers physically separate from the general population: it stops them running away before battle! Life in barracks is also totally organised around the business of turning men into warriors, something which is not easy for the raw material to endure. However, quite often, the attractions of not labouring in a field, regular meals, a bed and a roof were enough to keep peasants in the ranks. Life in the ranks might be dangerous, but it was a good deal less arduous than working on a farm and, on balance, the dangers were relative. A peasant faced death by accident and starvation; a soldier at least had a chance to make his own fate.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Buff_2_Hunting_Lodge_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nHunting teaches men to fire accurately and quickly against swift-moving targets. To miss is to go hungry! Therefore, a hunting lodge improves the firing accuracy of missile-armed troops recruited in this province. \n\nArchery in Japan was not only about warfare but also about hunting, both for pleasure and for food. The stalking and shooting skills needed to bring down prey with the minimum amount of fuss were directly transferable to warfare, as a man who could put an arrow cleanly into a deer could do the same to another man.\n\nHunting and war also used exactly the same equipment. Despite their poetic names, the narrow willow-leaf, willow-leaf and dragon’s tongue were all lethally sharp arrow heads designed to kill the target by lacerating flesh and causing massive bleeding. Any animal, or man, for that matter, would soon bleed to death after being hit. On the other hand, archers used the blunt, turnip-shaped signal arrows against their targets when dog hunting. These made an eerie whistling sound as they flew. </long_description>

<key>SHO_Buff_2_Jiujutsu_Dojo_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nJujutsu is a collection of martial arts, involving both armed and unarmed techniques. Because there is little point in striking an armoured opponent with bare hands, jujutsu techniques often involve grappling and throwing an enemy. In particular, there is an emphasis on using an enemy’s weight and energy against him. A jujutsu expert almost appears to help his opponent miss an attack, and then fall over painfully, and often fatally. The jujutsu dojo therefore improves the close combat abilities of any units recruited in the province, as the troops receive training from the masters here.\n\nMartial arts have a long history in Japan, but during the Sengoku Jidai the ability to fight with whatever was to hand could be the difference between life and death. Jujutsu at this time was not a purely unarmed form of combat. Indeed, if a short weapon was available, there was almost certainly a school of jujutsu that took advantage of it. The tanto, or knife, was often used, along with the manrikigusari, a weighted chain and a whole class of nasty objects called kakushi buki, or hidden weapons. This old-school jujutsu was not a sport, but a serious method of self-defence. </long_description>

<key>SHO_Buff_2_Proving_Grounds_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nIt is not enough for a warrior to know how to fight. The individual hunting personal glory is useless unless he contributes to the overall victory. He must learn to fight alongside his comrades as part of a unit, adding his strength to theirs. This involves drill, practice and faith in your brothers-in-arms. When all in a unit fight as one, their strength is magnified. These proving grounds will improve the charge bonus of any units recruited in the province. \n\nDrill has always been part of the soldiers’ lot. While it may seem pointless to a new recruit, the habit of instant obedience and being able to move to the right place within the unit without thinking are vital. Quick and co-ordinated action saves lives on the battlefield, at least among those who master the concept. Disciplined men stop being a rabble and become a single creature with many weapons. This becomes obvious on the charge: a single mass makes the shock of impact so much greater than a rag-tag gaggle of men arriving a few at a time. The disciplined mass will do more damage to the enemy, and individuals within the unit have a better chance of survival.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Castle_1_Fort_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nA fort is a basic defence against attackers, and can be garrisoned with troops to slow down and hinder any enemy incursions. Even the smallest castle can be difficult to take, and leaving the garrison unmolested and behind an advancing army is not always an option. A fort is also a symbol to the locals to remind them of their overlord’s power, and it can be used as a recruiting centre for some basic types of warrior.\n\nHistorically, the castles of the early Sengoku Jidai were a good deal less majestic than what is now considered to be the classical Japanese castle. The first castles were practical structures, made of wood and without multi-storeyed towers and stone walls. They were used for the defence and surveillance of the surrounding region, where the grand later buildings were also lordly mansions and seats of government, often with entire towns built around them. Early castles were located on rivers, at ports and other strategic points, and cunningly took full advantage of the natural landscape: mountainous positions were favoured, and nearby streams were diverted and dammed as moats. It was common for the defenders to not lurk behind their walls when attacked: the defenders would, more often than not, sally forth to meet the enemy rather than rely on the walls.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Castle_2_Stronghold_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nA stronghold looms above the people in their villages, a reminder from dawn to dusk of where their loyalties should lie, and to whom they must pay their taxes. It is a strong base for the local garrison troops, enabling them to control the area, and act as a barrier to any invader. The stronghold also acts as a centre for recruiting new troops to serve in the daimyo’s armies, and helps increase the clan’s fame.\n\nStone was introduced as a construction material for Japanese castles to provide protection against the elements and create sturdy foundations, always a problem in a nation so beset by earthquakes. Stone foundations also allowed the building to have more storeys. A large, sloped foundation platform was first carved out of the earth, which was then clad in stone to make a very strong bastion. These foundations could support impressive multi-storeyed towers, a sign of wealth and power. The bastions were also obstacles for any enemy attack, and were perfect for the defenders to rain arrows down on besiegers. </long_description>

<key>SHO_Castle_3_Fortress_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nTo properly defend and govern a province, a daimyo requires a strong base. That a fortress also inspires respect, even fear, among his people is no bad thing either. A fortress represses a province by its presence, helps the tax yield, and increases the fame of a clan, as rivals and enemies are awed by its construction. Any garrison can hold out against enemy attacks, and the castle acts as a centre for recruiting troops. \n\nThe development of castle design coincided with the rise in importance of the warrior classes in Japan. Warfare grew in scale, and the castle also grew so it could withstand prolonged sieges; the traditional wooden fortifications could no longer be expected to hold out against large armies with siege engines. The Hojo clan was responsible for the defences of Odawara, built in 1416. The castle survived two sieges before it finally fell in 1590 to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Odawara was actually the central defensive position of a network of castles, as it was surrounded by smaller, satellite fortresses. Some of them, in turn, had their own ring of satellite forts. The entire system provided a layered defence that was extremely difficult and time-consuming for an enemy to reduce. </long_description>

<key>SHO_Castle_4_Castle_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nBuilding a castle is a sign of absolute ownership, as it provides a strong defence against enemy assaults and a centralized administration for the province. It is a clear sign of the builder’s prestige and wealth. With such a massive structure to defend them, the people will feel secure, but they will also understand that they must keep to their allotted stations in life. Tax income is also improved for the owning clan.\n\nThe Sengoku Jidai saw castles develop far beyond mere military strongholds and into being the central hubs for entire towns. The castle was where the daimyo lived, had his government, and encouraged the arts and culture. For the daimyo’s reputation, it was important to impress and intimidate guests in equal measure. The inner layout was designed to force the enemy along complex, exposed routes to the central citadel, so that they could be under fire every step of the way.\n\nThe cost of building and maintaining even one castle was almost crippling, so it became a measurable and public example of wealth, power and good taste. A great deal of prestige was gained by a daimyo’s patronage of the arts, and special pieces were commissioned often portraying beautiful landscapes or the clan’s victories, all designed to subtly display the clan’s virtues!</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThis awe-inspiring building is intended to make all who see it marvel, or tremble, at its scale and the power it represents. It is a monument to the untrammelled wealth and military might of a daimyo and his clan. Cunningly built to confuse and confound attackers, it also serves to intimidate the local people who live, work, pay taxes and die in its shadow. It is of such magnificence that it also increases the prestige of its builders.\n\nTowards the end of the Sengoku Jidai, castles became even larger and more elaborate, as they evolved from military fortresses to cultural and economic centres for the surrounding provinces. The castle at Himeji was one such structure, built by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1581 on top of Himeyama as a three-storey tower and then completely reworked by Ikeda Terumasa, his son-in-law. The hill position made it a formidable defensive site, and the inner citadel compound was a maze of courtyards and compounds to frustrate any enemy who gained entry. The rebuilt castle was all of that, but remains even today a spectacular and refined palace. It is still a popular tourist attraction.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nAn army of peasants will fight as peasants. An army of foot soldiers will be ponderous. An army with horses will be fleet and deadly! Stables allow the training of light cavalry, who can quickly move across a battlefield to exploit a weakness or hold a line.\n\nMythology has it that the monkey protects horses and stables. This belief has its roots in the Chinese story “Journey to the West” about a monk and his companions, a monkey, a pig and a water spirit travelling to India. The monkey is making the trip as penance for disobedience to the Jade Emperor, who appointed him protector of horses to calm his desire for power. The monkey image is often found on stables, and a particular fine “hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil” set of images can be seen at the Toshuga Shrine, built to honour Tokugawa Ieyasu.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nWhere horses are available these stables allow the recruitment of a wide range of cavalry units. Battle tests the spirit of horses as surely as it tests their strength. Some are better suited to the clamour and din than others, and accept the training required of them. Warhorses must be able to ride headlong into an angry crowd, ignore flames, and keep going even when every natural instinct tells them to run.\n\nAs might be expected, cavalry furniture for horses in Japan developed in a somewhat different fashion compared to the rest of the world. Japanese saddles were traditionally made of wood, and carefully designed to give the rider a stable platform for archery. Such considerations made them unsuitable for use over long distances, or at speed, as they were heavy and uncomfortable. The reins and bridle, however, were light and made of silk. The strangest pieces of equipment, to outside eyes, were the umagutsu. These straw sandals were shoes for the horses, and very similar to human footwear. The umagutsu provided extra traction in wet conditions, and this alone was no small matter when battles were often fought across paddy fields and farmland. They also helped quieten the sound of the horses’ hooves.</long_description>

Bajutsu, or the skill of horse riding, is as much about training the man as the horse. A master is not just a horseman, he is also a warrior, scholar and teacher. He can read a battle, understand a horse and teach even the most unpromising student.\n\nThere were many schools of horsemanship in medieval Japan. Each had its own style and specialities, but all agreed that it was the bond between rider and horse that made a cavalry warrior. Students were expected to know everything about their mounts. They were also expected to stay in the saddle no matter what happened, be able to guide the animal with their knees, and fight with spear, bow and sword. Most schools favoured tractable animals for easy training, but on the Kanto plain high-spirited horses were preferred. These mounts took more breaking in, but were thought to make better battle steeds.</long_description>

The masters here have moved beyond understanding their skill to a state where they embody their skill. They are at one with their horses, weapons and comrades-in-arms, and can perform acts of martial skill that are almost unrivalled.\n\nHorses, according to myth, are much hunted as prey by kappa, or water spirits, who try to pull them down to a watery death. Stories tell of kappas being caught and forced to promise never to attack horses again, usually with positive results in that the promises are kept. A horse-headed warrior, rather than a spirit, also serves the ruler of Hell, Emma-O. This guard, along with an ox-headed warrior, bring the dead before Emma-O and his magic mirror that reflects all the sins of a deceased man so that Emma-O may judge them fairly. </long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe humility of this structure belies its spiritual power. The missionaries that go forth from here are capable of converting the people to Christianity, and of spreading sedition among enemies. The building itself is more than a meeting place: like all churches, the design formally codifies the details of the faith. \n\nThe Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier brought Christianity to Japan in 1549. Despite language difficulties, he was modestly successful in communicating Christian ideas to his new flock. The Jesuits were a relatively new, vigorous order within the Catholic Church, formed to fight the Protestant ideas of Martin Luther. As “shock troops” of the Reformation, they had both a martial and scholarly air to them that was undoubtedly appealing to samurai sensibilities. However, Christianity faced much hostility because it did not honour ancestors. Indeed, missionaries told their Japanese audience that their ancestors were damned or, at best, virtuous pagans. Despite these problems, the Christian community probably numbered around 100,000 people by 1579. Francis Xavier would eventually be canonized as a saint for his efforts in the far-flung foreign lands. He is still a Catholic patron saint of missionaries.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA hospital will aid the conversion of the Japanese to Christianity, also increasing unit replenishment, economic growth and the happiness of the Christian populace. It will improve the rate at which the arts are mastered and allow a besieged army in the same castle town to hold out longer.\n\nThe Society of Jesus, commonly called the Jesuits, was founded in 1534. Taking vows of poverty and celibacy, and with a fanatical devotion to the Catholic faith, the early Jesuits soon began to proselytise in the new Portuguese settlements of the Far East. Following the first appearance of Portuguese traders at Tanegashima in 1543, the Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier arrived on Japanese soil with the intention of converting Japan to Catholicism. Unfortunately, the largely Shinto and Buddhist faithful did not easily accept Catholic ideas. Arriving during the most serious civil war in Japan&amp;#39;s history meant that many daimyo were disinterested in Xavier&amp;#39;s work, and, once Buddhist monks realised that Catholicism was a rival faith, they spoke out against him. However, Catholicism did flourish in the domain of the Otomo, who saw both economic and military benefits in trade with Portugal. Their daimyo, Otomo Sorin, was willing to allow his people to choose their own religion if it meant easier access to guns. Eventually Xavier was successful after he drew parallels between Jesuit Catholicism and the spiritual world of his Japanese students. Although he eventually learned Japanese, Xavier initially found the language impenetrable, and spread his message through Catholic iconography. His success eventually led to the appearance of Jesuit hospitals, seminaries and colleges across Otomo territory.</long_description>

Centuries-old traditions, including in matters of faith, were considered to be a unifying force. In 1636 Dutch traders, the last Europeans in Japan, were confined to Dejima Island in Nagasaki harbour, effectively barring foreign influences, including foreign religions. The Jesuits had already gone home with the Portuguese, and the Dutch were more interested in profit than proselytising. Dejima was forbidden territory to the Japanese, save for the few allowed to live there and service Dutch needs. Japan remained largely closed to outsiders and their alien ideas for over 200 years.</long_description>

It also, however, significantly increases the unease and unhappiness of the Buddhist population in the area. The building itself is a mark of how seriously a province’s rulers take their Christian faith. \n\nHistorically, there was little agreement between daimyos as to the best way to deal with Christians and Christianity. Some saw it as a way of increasing trade with the outside world and, of course, getting more European guns; others saw it as a different path to God; still others viewed the faith with hostility as being un-Japanese. In 1597 Toyotomi Hideyoshi made his position perfectly clear when he had 26 Japanese and European Catholics rounded up, tortured and publically crucified. This horrible fate had its intended effect: warning his people against the risks inherent in the new, foreign faith.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA Jesuit seminary increases the rate of conversion to Christianity, as well as improving economic growth, the happiness of Christian populace in its province, unit replenishment, and mastery of the arts. It also enables a besieged force in the same castle town to hold out longer against their attackers.\n\nThe Society of Jesus, commonly called the Jesuits, was founded in 1534. Taking vows of poverty and celibacy, and with a fanatical devotion to the Catholic faith, the early Jesuits soon began to proselytise in the new Portuguese settlements of the Far East. Following the first appearance of Portuguese traders at Tanegashima in 1543, the Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier arrived on Japanese soil with the intention of converting Japan to Catholicism. Unfortunately, the largely Shinto and Buddhist faithful did not easily accept Catholic ideas. Arriving during the most serious civil war in Japan&amp;#39;s history meant that many daimyo were disinterested in Xavier&amp;#39;s work, and, once Buddhist monks realised that Catholicism was a rival faith, they spoke out against him. However, Catholicism did flourish in the domain of the Otomo, who saw both economic and military benefits in trade with Portugal. Their daimyo, Otomo Sorin, was willing to allow his people to choose their own religion if it meant easier access to guns. Eventually Xavier was successful after he drew parallels between Jesuit Catholicism and the spiritual world of his Japanese students. Although he eventually learned Japanese, Xavier initially found the language impenetrable, and spread his message through Catholic iconography. His success eventually led to the appearance of Jesuit hospitals, seminaries and colleges across Otomo territory.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Christian_4_Cathedral_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nA cathedral is a mighty structure, demonstrating the profound faith of their builders to the world. It is a major investment of time, money and craftsmanship, a hymn to God given physical, almost intimidating reality. The sheer size and magnificence of this building impresses people and converts them to Christianity across a wide area. The cathedral brings in a large number of worshippers, increasing the province’s income, and adds to the happiness of the local Christian population.\n\nOoura Cathedral in Nagasaki is Japan’s oldest wooden cathedral, but it is a building from the Meiji Restoration, almost 300 years after the Sengoku Jidai. Constructed in 1865 under the oversight of Frenchman Bernard Petitjean, it is now recognised as a national treasure. Earlier structures on the main islands did not survive under the Tokugawa Shogunate: in 1614 an edict banned the practice of Christianity and forced the faith underground. Ooura Cathedral was constructed in part to honour the hidden Christians of Japan, the “kakure kirishitan”, who did not renounce their faith when ordered to do so by the Shoguns. Life became easier for them once the Tokugawa Shogunate ended, and Japan opened up once again to the outside world. In the space of a few decades, Japan went from a quiet backwater to an industrialised society, capable of taking on, and beating, the mighty Russian Empire in 1905. Foreign ideas were still foreign, but they were no longer forbidden.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Crafts_1_Market_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nA market adds to a province’s wealth and growth, and also allows a clan to recruit metsuke as agents. When two peasants barter, there is a market. When many come to do the same, there is wealth to be made and probably taxed. A permanent market can offer many services and goods for everyone in the province, and allow people to sell their surplus goods. Once people can trade, they can specialise, even a little, produce more and then trade for what they lack. A wise ruler encourages this.\n\nIt was, of course, beneath any samurai to engage in anything as common as trade. Wealth came from rents, land ownership and in rewards for loyal service. Often, wealth was accumulated in the form of rice koku, as taxes in kind. It was left to others to do business, and live as merchants in towns. Under the Tokugawa Shogunate, the merchants did gain a certain practical influence, because they were the only people that the rice-rich daimyos and samurai could sell their koku to. The rice bartering system was never able to compete with a proper cash economy, if only because of the difficulty of moving mountains of rice sacks around!</long_description>

<key>SHO_Crafts_2_Rice_Exchange_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nA rice exchange significantly improves a province’s wealth and growth. Rather than each village relying on its own crops and living from harvest to harvest, an exchange allows merchants to buy up rice crops, and ship them to market as needed. Overall, the effect is to even out the good and bad harvests at some cost to the peasants, who may not always be able to afford the food they have grown.\n\nMerchants were part of the social class of chonin, or townsmen. This gave them few privileges compared to the samurai warrior class. However, they were able to amass considerable wealth. This helped them survive the transition from an age of warfare to an age of enforced peace under the Tokugawa Shogunate. Business went on as usual and, if anything, improved. In the long run, the samurai were not so fortunate: their social caste meant that they could not work and retain their honour as samurai. The strict social edicts of the Tokugawas didn’t help either, and many samurai were reduced to penury when there was no longer constant warfare. </long_description>

<key>SHO_Crafts_3_Merchant_Guild_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nA merchants’ guild greatly improves a province’s wealth and growth. Rather than competing with each other, a town’s merchant class work together, pool their resources and information, and look forward to enlarged profits. They can at last start to plan beyond the next harvest, or for the arrival of the next shipment of trade goods. \n\nAssociations of merchants were useful for collective risk-taking and collective bargaining. One merchant alone had little chance of getting any concession from his samurai overlords, but an entire town’s worth of merchants could present a united, if still respectful, front. Guilds were granted trading rights within a lord’s territory, in return for certain considerations. From a lord’s point of view, he could influence trade, tax it effectively, take a share of the wealth and still not actually sully his hands in the dirty business of trade. By acting together, the merchants could help finance major trade enterprises when one man alone would have difficulty raising the required working capital.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Crafts_4_Kanabukama_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nThis is a merchants’ association or mutual trading company, where the powerful manage trade both for themselves and others. The kabunakama even controls the trade activities of smaller merchants’ guilds, can set prices on goods, and can even bar dishonest or immoral merchants from trade altogether. The kabunakama does not exist to promote competition among merchants, but cooperation and, as a result, it boosts a province’s wealth and growth enormously and also improves the quality of metsuke who are recruited as agents.\n\nHistorically, kabunakama had much in common with the merchant adventurers and great trading companies of Europe. Often, they were granted trade rights in a town or over a particular commodity, but were then expected to pay substantial taxes to the Shogun or daimyo for the privilege. Selling monopoly rights was something that all ruling classes did, as it was profitable and did not involve nobles in any of the sordid money-grubbing of common trade. Merchants did not, however, trade overseas with foreigners, except in very carefully controlled ways. Despite their enormous wealth, the merchants of the kabunakama did not improve their social status: as trading townsmen they were still far lower in the social pecking order than honest, hardworking peasant folk.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Farming_1_Rice_Paddies_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nPaddies are the artificially flooded fields where rice is grown. Rice is the staple foodstuff of all Japanese people, from the lowly peasant growing the crop to the mightiest daimyo enjoying his rice from an exquisitely elegant bowl. Taxes are measured in koku, or sacks of rice. Each province’s basic wealth and therefore potential tax yield is measured by its rice output. \n\nWorking in rice paddies has always been long, exhausting work. The preparation of small dikes and channels to manage the water supply is a huge task for any farmer. Once the fields are properly laid out and flooded, the individual rice plants have to be hand-planted one at a time, a backbreaking task for anyone. The work was often communal, as most villages were self-governing and self-sustaining. A successful crop was not guaranteed, and a poor harvest would be doubly devastating as the peasants starved and their taxes to the local daimyo, often in taken rice, went unpaid. The violent repercussions of such disrespect and failure were rightly feared. Where the ruling clan was too weak or ineffective to impose taxes things were often no easier, as bandits would quite happily impose their own “taxes” on villagers. From the villagers’ perspective, there was little to choose between taxmen and bandits. In this, at least, the Japanese peasants were identical to others all across the world.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Farming_2_Irrigation_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nFarmers must use every scrap of land as efficiently as possible to grow enough food to survive and pay their taxes. By using water intelligently, more land can be cultivated and to better effect. The result is that the wealth of a province is improved, along with its potential to be taxed.\n\nThe landscape of Japan was, and is, dominated by mountains, volcanoes and densely wooded areas, leaving very little good, level farmland. To overcome this, farmers had to exploit the numerous small rivers by diverting and damming them to irrigate their lands. In addition, wet farming overcomes the acidic soils produced by volcanic activity and keeps the growth of weeds to a controllable minimum.\n\nOrganised irrigation in Asia can be traced back to ancient China where, in 256 BC, a system was constructed at Dujiangyan to divert water from the Min River. This not only prevented flooding and watered crops but also allowed the river to be used for military transports. As with many other ideas, the Japanese copied the idea from the Chinese and cleverly refined it over the centuries. Dujiangyan is still impressive today.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Farming_3_Terraces_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nTerrace farming increases the amount of land that can be cultivated, and so adds to the wealth and potential tax income of a province. Eventually farmers will use every square inch of level land available, at which point they must make more. By carefully shaping the hills into a series of giant steps, new land can be created that is suitable for farming. Each step becomes a new, ribbon-shaped paddy field that hugs the contours of a hill. If this is done cunningly – and there is little point doing otherwise – water is used and re-used as it flows downhill over the terraces.\n\nTerrace farming is used in many parts of the world with mountainous landscapes. The landscape is carefully formed into a system of contour-following platforms, with water cascading down from the highest level to the lowest. The result is an extremely efficient use of available space, even where paddy fields are not used; in the Andes of South America terraces were used for virtually all crops, for example. The result is also extremely picturesque, and an impressive piece of human, manual landscaping. The technique still finds favour today because it can stop heavy erosion and help prevent landslides as well as being an effective agricultural method.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Farming_4_Consolidation_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nLand is the source of all wealth, and the ownership and control of land is vital to the success of any lord. By consolidating land holdings, more and more land is put into the ownership of fewer and fewer people. While this does deprive the peasantry of lands, it does enable proper investment in agriculture, making the land more profitable, just not equally profitable for everyone!\n\nWhen the Tokugawa Shogunate was established in 1603, a powerful centralized government once again existed in Japan. Most of the other, lesser daimyo were allowed to retain their lands, but were answerable for their good behaviour to the new Shogun. A new era of peace allowed the daimyo to reorganise their own lands; villages that had become a little too independent were brought back under control. In this, Japan was not much different from other parts of the world, such as Europe, where peasants were having their commons confiscated by the gentry and nobility. The Tokugawa ruled until 1868, when the Meiji Restoration restored power to the Emperor and his Court. The daimyos of 1868 were ordered to turn all their lands over to Emperor Komei, and Japan was formally reorganised into a series of prefectures.</long_description>

<long_description>The temple is the centre of the community. From within its walls, monks spread the teachings of Buddha to the people, converting many and inciting others to revolt. The temple monks bring a message of hope too, spreading happiness and, in war, their presence is an inspiration. Unlike other Buddhist sects, Jodo Shinshu Buddhism placed great importance on the lives of those who followed its teachings. Followers were not expected to devote their entire lives to study. Instead, their faith was to be part of their ordinary, everyday lives. It was these principles that brought about the Ikko Ikki. As well as strong religious beliefs, the Ikko Ikki had equally strong political beliefs, desiring an end to feudal government, the Shoguns and the whole state. Instead, the people would rule themselves, and the Ikko Ikki were willing to die to bring about their aims. Naturally, this pitted them against the great lords of the time, including Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga. It would be Nobunaga who eventually brought destruction to the sect at the brutal battle of Nagashima.\n\nThis building can only be constructed by the Ikko Ikki and cannot be used by any other clan.</long_description>

<long_description>A monastery allows the masses somewhere to gather so they may honour the teachings of Buddha. This is a solid symbol of local commitment to Jodo Shinshu Buddhism; it increases the happiness of all the faithful and spreads the word too. Christians, however, may feel threatened by, and unhappy because of, the presence of this vigorous and forceful sect. In a determined rejection of the old style of Buddhism, Jodo Shinshu buildings differ greatly from other Buddhist structures. They are not built with the main hall, the hondo, facing southwards; rather, the hall faces east to honour Buddha who looks eastwards from his western Paradise. Unlike other sects, a Jodo Shinshu hondo is always dedicated to Shinran Shonin, as a goeido, or “founder’s hall”. Other Buddhist temples dedicate the main hall to one of the many Buddhist gods. A second hall for mass worship is also dedicated to Buddha, and there are few training areas and dormitory blocks for the monks. There are even quarters set aside for married monks in the style of private homes and gardens, quite separate from the temple’s public spaces.\n\nThis building can only be constructed by the Ikko Ikki and cannot be used by any other clan.</long_description>

<long_description>This is a safe haven for religious reflection, worship and, most importantly, training. The people can also be protected from surrounding clans as they vie for power and land. The monks here can concentrate on spreading the faith, converting the uneducated, and acting as a focus for the already faithful. The construction of a fortified monastery will inspire peasants in neighbouring provinces too: there is another way, rather than submitting to the cruelty of the daimyo and their samurai armies! Jodo Shinshu, or Pure Land Buddhism, was an inclusive set of teachings which proposed that anyone could be guaranteed salvation and rebirth. There was no need to become a monk, or spend hours in meditation. Such activities simply weren’t an option for the ever-toiling peasantry, so a faith that gave them hope and the promise of freedom had a definite appeal. The common people were often trapped between warring clans, and Jodo Shinshu offered them the chance of something better, the chance to be without warlords. The Ikko Ikki were the direct result of Jodo Shinshu and the violence of the times, the chance for non-samurai to have a better life for themselves.\n\nThis building can only be constructed by the Ikko Ikki and cannot be used by any other clan.</long_description>

<long_description>This massive complex of temples and halls is dedicated to the Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, and is open to every monk, peasant or samurai who wishes to worship and learn. The old doctrines are set aside, as the teachings of Jodo Shinshu hold that anyone can attain enlightenment, and that solitary meditation is not the only path. Construction of this magnificent shrine brings happiness to the Ikko Ikki, and improves unit replenishment as followers volunteer their services. The Ishiyama Honganji was built in 1496, a huge temple complex that housed the headquarters for the Ikko Ikki. It was constructed in Settsu after Rennyo (1415-99), the priest responsible for rejuvenating the faith, retired. His followers settled around him, building homes and eventually a mighty, self-contained fortress protected by its own moat and guarded by hundreds of Ikko monks. In 1570 and 1576 Oda Nobunaga laid siege to the fortress, only to be seen off by the Ikko Ikki and their allies. A second attempt in 1576 was successful, as Nobunaga gradually strangled the fortress, cutting off its outlying areas and isolating it from any help. After four years of the siege, the Honganji capitulated in 1580.\n\nThis building can only be constructed by the Ikko Ikki and cannot be used by any other clan.</long_description>

Although they may not have realised it, the daimyo relied on their people to maintain their power and wealth. While trade might be welcome, the population could not be allowed to move freely, otherwise they might simply leave in search of a better lord. Such a turn of events was unthinkable. Travel, therefore, was made more difficult than might be expected, to keep the people in their proper place.

All travellers are carefully monitored at each station, so that line of sight is increased and there is also a better chance of detecting enemy agents. Along each of these roads are a series of post stations, where officials can rest on their journeys but, more importantly, where all other travellers must present the correct documentation before they can travel onwards. The roads are rather good and allow swift passage, but only to those with the right paperwork. \n\nPost stations were places where travellers could rest during their journeys. Lodgings were constructed for officials and government agents, but all kinds of taverns could be found there too. Of course, anyone who stopped at a post town or station would be seen and recorded, so as well as helping travel, the post stations also served as a warning system if unwelcome or shady characters came through. These were first established under the Tokugawa Shogunate, a regime which had every interest in maintaining peace and social control after the chaos and wars of the Sengoku Jidai.</long_description>

The post stations monitor all travellers, so that line of sight and the chance of detecting enemy agents are greatly increased. As long as the right paperwork is presented whenever requested, a traveller can make excellent progress along one of these fine roads. The wrong documentation, however, can spell disaster!\n\nTokugawa Ieyasu, the eventual victor of the Sengoku Jidai and Shogun of Japan, created five great land routes through the country, all leading from Edo. These roads were intended primarily to secure his control over the country, as they allowed his armies to move swiftly to confront any troublemakers. Immensely useful as this was to the Tokugawa Shogunate, the roads were also too useful for internal trade and travel not to be used for civilian purposes. Ieyasu’s successors built a network of post stations along these roads so that travellers could rest. The roads remained in use until after the Meiji Restoration when, along with many other foreign ideas, railways arrived in Japan.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA regular haul of fish can help sustain and grow a community, supplying a source of both fresh food and income. It is also the foundation for a larger construct, which can be expanded to specialise as either a trading or military port. A good coastal village can become the heart of a community, providing jobs for the populace and the money needed to start families, growing as the fishing business grows.\n\nHistorically, the divisions between social classes in Japan were very clear and seen as vital for the maintenance of good order in the country. Social status and employment were often tightly intertwined, and most jobs had a hereditary element to them: sons followed fathers into the same trade. As well as restrictions on weaponry, the clothes and housing of classes were also laid down in law and custom. Fishermen and farmers had to work hard for little money, but their status was certainly higher than townsmen and merchants. When, under the Tokugawas, some commoners attempted to improve their homes with features copied from the warrior classes, the Shogunate discouraged the practice almost immediately.

<long_description>\n\nBuilding a harbour provides a province with basic ship building capabilities, useful in keeping up with rival clans and their maritime ambitions. The harbour also creates new work opportunities for local people, encouraging economic growth.\n\nAll Japanese lords were acutely aware of the danger of invasion from the sea. The Mongols had tried to do this in both 1274 and 1281, and it was only divine intervention that had saved Japan. Though an island people, the Japanese did not really develop into a naval power when compared to other nations with long coastlines. Sea battles never really evolved beyond a series of boarding actions. The idea of attacking and sinking a ship was never really pursued with vigour.\n\nJapan did, however, have a pirate tradition and a pirate problem. The Japanese government seemed either unwilling or unable to bring their pirates to heel, and this created tensions with nearby nations. Eventually, the pirates became rich and powerful enough to become respectable “sea lords” and carved out territories for themselves, or worked for the richest clans!</long_description>

Warships built here can protect the port’s trading vessels, which in turn earn money to buy more warships. A busy port encourages growth in the province too.\n\nHistorically, Japan was organised along strict social divisions, with fishermen and farmers classed as commoners, while samurai warriors and daimyos were the superior class. Because they did no honourable work, merchants had a lower status than the peasants. The merchants, however, were wealthy, as the samurai considered trade to be a necessary evil, but one that could be left to others. This snobbishness was all very well, but the samurai eventually found themselves unsuited to a peaceful Japan or a modernising Japan after 1868. The merchant classes had, in effect, eclipsed them, leaving the samurai with few honourable ways of making a living.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA military port specialises in the construction and maintenance of warships. These vessels are built for battle, and are not just floating platforms for warriors. This makes them expensive, and means that special yards are needed ashore, but also means that vessels can be properly repaired here too.\n\nHistorically, the Japanese had no warships to speak of until the Sengoku Jidai. Though they had fought at sea, the ships were floating platforms for archers and warriors who would board enemy vessels to fight a land battle at sea. Ships were simply armoured with the same kind of wooden screens foot soldiers carried into battle, and so were vulnerable to fire arrows and bombs hurled from the decks. The intention, however, was to always close with the enemy and fight honourably in close combat. Sinking an enemy vessel might have been more effective, but it was not a proper way to conduct warfare.</long_description>

The trade growth is, of course, a welcome extra benefit. \n\nNanban means “southern barbarian” and was the term used for European traders who came to Japan in the 1540s: they approached from the south, after all, and were barbarous by local standards. They certainly had few manners, precious little understanding of the proper way of doing things, and brought a strange religion with them. They were, however, welcomed because of the new matchlock firearms that they brought with them from Europe. The Japanese soon realised that ashigaru could be trained cheaply and quickly to use these new weapons, and it was not long before local makers were producing guns every bit as good as, and in some cases superior to, the European arquebuses.</long_description>

With such a yard shipwrights can construct the largest and most powerful ships to add to a clan’s navy.\n\nHistorically, it was not until the Sengoku Jidai that the Japanese started building warships, but not for any national fleet. Once shipbuilding did get underway, the vessels produced were huge and resembled nothing quite so much as floating castles. Only six of the largest ships, the almost-legendary O-ataka bunes complete with iron armour, were ever built, probably because they were cripplingly expensive to build, man and maintain. Oda Nobunaga commissioned them and they were used at the Battle of Kizugawaguchi in 1578, where a fatal weakness was revealed. If they were boarded and the fighting meant that one side of the ship was too heavy, they had a nasty tendency to roll and capsize, taking everyone to the briny depths!</long_description>

<key>SHO_Port_4_Nanban_Quarter_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nA nanban quarter allows foreigners greater trade rights in a province, and a new trade route is there to be exploited. This relatively free exchange of goods and ideas can be profitable, and allows the construction of European ship designs in the local yards.\n\nThe nanban trade between the “southern barbarians” and the Japanese existed from 1543 until the Tokugawa Shoguns closed the country to foreign disturbances in 1641. The Portuguese, who had first opened trade with Japan, were also the first to be excluded. They had, after all, brought a fairly aggressive form of Catholicism, in the form of the Jesuits, to Japan. The Dutch managed to hang on, but their presence was circumscribed and barely tolerated. Eventually they were confined to Dejima, an artificial island in Nagasaki Bay, although their guns were still welcome. Japan remained isolated from the outside world until the Convention of Kanegawa in 1854, a piece of not-quite-gunboat diplomacy by Commodore Matthew C. Perry of the US Navy.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Portuguese_Land</key>
<long_description>\n\nThis land can be handed over to foreign, Portuguese control for them to do with as they wish. In return, the clan gains a large amount of money. However, there is a loss of respect among all right-thinking Japanese who see no need to give any of Japan to foreigners.\n\nThat it was the Portuguese rather than the Spanish getting involved in Japan during this period was the result of the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494, brokered by the Catholic Church. This treaty had divided the whole world between Catholic Spain and Catholic Portugal, without any reference to any other European powers. While the Pope, a Spaniard, had not been directly involved, he was certainly happy to endorse the arrangement. Any thought for the natives who might not want to be colonised or exploited was, of course, completely lacking. Japan fell in the Portuguese sphere of influence, so the Spanish stayed away. Quite how happy the Shogun and his daimyo would have been if this treaty had been made known to them is an interesting bit of speculation. The chances are that the implicit arrogance of the European Catholics would have scuppered any chance of trade, let alone anything else. It might have cost many Europeans their heads, too.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nBy investing in the artisans of this province it is possible to help the economy grow through paper production and other craft industries or, by specialising in fletchers, you can improve the accuracy of the clan’s bow-armed units. Craftsmen of all kinds are vital to a province, and add to the quality of life for all the people. Even the simplest peasant can appreciate good workmanship when he sees and uses something.\n\nCraftsmanship has always been admired in Japan, and no matter how it is expressed: from the calligrapher who produces the perfect brush stroke, to the potter who makes a perfect bowl. What is required from all of these men and women is absolute dedication to their craft and, eventually, the ability to make the remarkably difficult seem easy.\n\nToday the Japanese government recognises great craftsmen as ningen kokuho “living national treasures” or, more properly, juyo mukei bunkazai hojisha which translates as “preservers of important intangible cultural properties”.

<long_description>\n\nAlthough ninja may be regarded as dangerous, troublesome and underhanded, there is no denying their usefulness to a daimyo. An enemy who meets a knife in the dark will be just as dead as one killed in battle. The ninja here can be encouraged along two paths: to become better killers, or to act as smugglers, and improve the income of the province.\n\nNinja “clans” were not uncommon in Japan, as families tended to pass the secrets of ninjutsu between father and son. The matter was never openly talked about. Much of what is commonly believed about ninja is largely movie invention: even the ninjato, the ninja sword, has no proven historical basis. A ninja almost certainly carried a katana, the finest sword he could, if he carried a sword at all. Shuriken (darts, stars and other projectiles) were also carried and used.\n\nOne, possibly apocryphal tale, illustrates the dedication and danger of the ninja. Having been hired to assassinate a lord, the ninja allegedly waited down a toilet, surrounded by faeces, for the bottom of his target to appear in the appropriate place, then thrust home his blade.

<key>SHO_Siege_1_Workshop_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nThis building allows the construction of basic siege engines. Sooner or later a castle will need to be reduced or breached, and then taken from the enemy. The defending commander may even decide that his best course is to sit out the siege. It is at this point that an attack needs a really big weapon to break down the enemy walls.\n\nSieges often required quite advanced military engineering on the part of the attackers. At Noda Castle in 1573, when a corps of miners with the attacking Takeda army drained the moat, the defenders lost their water supply too. It was only the shooting of Lord Takeda Shingen by a sniper that halted the attack. However, there was also a notable tendency for Japanese garrisons to leave their castles and attack their besiegers. It was not always considered honourable to cower behind the walls when there was a clean fight to be had with your tormentors outside! It was quite possible for the besieging army to capture a castle almost intact, because the defenders had been terribly obliging and come out into the field to be killed in an honourable way. On the other hand, some garrisons were remarkably tenacious: at Odawara in 1561, the castle held out for two months, despite the town around it being burned to the ground. </long_description>

<key>SHO_Siege_2_Powder_Maker_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nThis building allows the training of horoku units. Gunpowder is notoriously tricky stuff to make safely, and there is more art to it than many would suspect. The ingredients used, their individual preparation, and the proportions needed for the final mix are all jealously guarded secrets. The final stages, when the powder is mixed with water, dried out, and then carefully ground to the correct size are particularly dangerous. One spark will spell disaster, particularly in Japan where so many buildings are made of wood!\n\nAlthough the Japanese had been on the receiving end of gunpowder weapons in the 13th century, courtesy of the Mongols, they chose not to use them in warfare. This was unusual, as the Japanese had not been particularly reticent about taking Chinese ideas of all kinds, refining them, and producing a distinctly excellent local version of all kinds of things. Striking down enemies at a distance with little chance of reply did not, however, easily sit within the samurai concept of bushido. It was one thing to shoot someone with an arrow, quite another to blow an enemy to small pieces.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Siege_3_Gunsmith_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nThis building allows the recruitment of matchlock-armed samurai units. By breaking the reliance on European guns, a lord can add considerably to his war-making potential. Given a suitable place to work, a Japanese gunsmith can be every bit as clever, cunning and productive as a gaijin on the other side of the world! \n\nOnce Japanese weapon smiths had seen European firearms and understood what they were about, it did not take long for local examples to be manufactured. Indeed, Japanese craftsmanship quickly improved on the imported examples of matchlocks, making them more practical battlefield weapons: Japanese gunsmiths added a foresight to guns years before Europeans thought of doing the same thing. Later they also invented a way of shielding the burning match from the rain. Needless to say, the locally made guns often displayed high quality workmanship and materials, and those guns intended for samurai users were well made and beautifully finished. The brown colour of many gun barrels was not the metal going rusty but a finish that would resist corrosion. </long_description>

<key>SHO_Siege_4_Arsenal_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nA large store of weapons, armour and other necessaries is vital to warfare. A general worth his sword knows that his men cannot march without shoes, fight without weapons or live without food. To command warriors is meaningless unless they have what they need to carry the fight to the enemy. The arsenal allows the recruitment of rocket units. In addition, an experienced force of matchlock samurai will always be present in the province for defensive purposes. The first clan to construct an arsenal will also benefit from improved reloading times for all matchlock-carrying troops.\n\nAs the wars of the Sengoku Jidai increased in ferocity and armies increased in size, weapons and armour became less a matter of choice for individual samurai, and more of a logistical nightmare. A samurai might well provide all his own war gear, but the thousands of ashigaru being recruited into the clan armies needed everything from helmets to socks and sandals. This lead to standardisation of equipment by all clans, and a literally uniform appearance in their respective warriors. In this, the Japanese warlords were well ahead of their European contemporaries.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA sake den makes people happy, after a fashion. There is much to be said in favour of a flask of sake at the end of a long, hard day, and many troubles look much smaller after a convivial evening. In the shadows, however, and hidden behind smiles, darker business can be transacted: secrets exchanged and arrangements made. Among other dangerous types, ninjas are to be found here.\n\nOne of the most popular beverages in Japan, sake was originally only produced in small quantities for personal consumption. In the 1300s, however, mass production began in larger distilleries, often near temples and shrines. In later years, the main producers kept to the same places thanks to the availability of good sake rice and good, clean water. Sake was often used in Shinto rituals, and today barrels of sake are still left at shrines as rather splendid offerings to the spirits. Sake is also central to the Shinto ceremony of “kagami biraki”, performed at weddings and festivals. Wooden casks of sake are smashed open with a mallet, and the drinks are then served to all the guests to bring them good fortune.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Stealth_2_Gambling_Hall_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nThe chance to gamble, with some small chance of winning, is a good way to keep people occupied and happy. The gambling hall helps to improve a province’s wealth and, additionally, attracts ninjas looking to sell their skills to the highest bidder. There is always a darker side to something that is, after all, less than entirely respectable.\n\nSocial standing was of utmost importance in feudal Japan. The gentry and warriors were at the top of the system, peasants below them, followed by artisans and merchants. There were, however, groups even lower than merchants, outcastes who did not even belong to society. These people included burakumin, the hinin, and the bakuto. The burakumin had jobs that were held to be taboo, such as undertakers and tanners: people who worked with the dead, human and animal (although, to be fair, tanning was a disgusting process and no one who had any sense of smell could stand being anywhere near). Hinin were almost non-human, defined as such by their actions: criminals and those such as actors and entertainers. The bakuto were gamblers, who did not earn an honest living. This did not stop them becoming rich and relatively powerful, although without status.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA town with no crime is too poor to have anything worth stealing! Crime syndicates, however, are not about theft: they provide all kinds of illicit and enjoyable services to the local people, even as they intimidate troublesome individuals into keeping quiet. The syndicate has a positive effect on wealth, give or take, and it aids in procuring the services of a dangerous class of men: battlefield ninjas. \n\nJapanese crime syndicates, the yakuza, have a long tradition and can trace their origins back to the era of the Tokugawa Shogunate and earlier. The name is deliberately ironic: a portmanteau of the Japanese for eight, nine and three, a losing hand at cards. From their start as gamblers, the yakuza became a mirror of samurai society, with their own codes of honour. Yakuza are famed for their tattoos, the elaborate designs showing that the wearer has the strength to take the pain of his decorative work. Other than yakuza, the only Japanese group to regularly carry tattoos are firemen. Tattoos are a reason for ordinary Japanese to be suspicious of strangers. </long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThis whole city quarter given over to every kind of entertainment does much to increase the wealth of the province, as many are drawn to sample its pleasures. Even though much is relatively harmless fun, there is also a darker side where other business can be transacted away from watchful eyes. The district allows the recruitment of geishas.\n\nThe concept of ukiyo or the “floating world” became formalised during the Edo period. Red light districts were not uncommon in great cities, but the one in Yoshiwara in Edo became the most elaborate and famous. Within its boundaries almost any form of entertainment was available for those with money. Visitors to the quarter were expected to leave their weapons behind, one of the few occasions when a samurai would willingly be disarmed!\n\nThe “water trade” or mizu shobai had its own rules, strictly defined hierarchy and did not necessarily involve sex at all. Entertainers, comedians, dancers and others were all part of the trade, but not sexually available. There was also a very clear distinction between a prostitute or courtesan and a geisha. A geisha was unlikely to become sexually involved with any of her customers, and especially not for pay. She was a highly skilled entertainer and escort, not a bed companion. </long_description>

<key>SHO_Sword_1_Sword_School_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nThe sword school allows the recruitment of katana samurai units. Use of the sword is a serious business, and the teaching and practice of sword fighting is equally serious. Students are expected to approach the subject with the deepest reverence. This is not unsurprising, given that a katana, or long sword, can easily sever a limb if handled carelessly!\n\nSamurai were the only people allowed to wear a pair of swords, the daisho (literally “long and short”) of a katana and a wakizashi. Constant practice was required to use a sword properly, and many schools taught the art of kenjutsu. Iaijutsu was also taught, but this was the specialised skill of drawing and striking with a sword away from the battlefield, a useful thing for self-defence in dangerous times. The emphasis in all teaching, however, was on combat, not on sport or fun. Style mattered, but only as long as it aided the serious business of beating an opponent. Teaching also concentrated on the katana, although a few practitioners, such as the famous sword-saint, Miyamoto Musashi, favoured a two-sword style.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Sword_2_Nodachi_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nThis dojo allows the recruitment of no-dachi samurai units, armed with fearsome greatswords. The use of these swords is a specialised art, and not all samurai are suited or able to use no-dachi. The weapon is also one that requires considerable space, even for practice. However, the men who can use the swords command considerable respect among their peers.\n\nThe term “dojo” means “the place of the way”, or a formal training setting for a particular martial art. Often these would be large halls built in temple grounds, but courtyards could also be used. In the case of a no-dachi, training would have to be in the open air.\n\nA no-dachi was instantly recognisable when carried because it was worn slung over the shoulder, but its great length meant that it could not be drawn from that position. It was a weapon for the open battlefield, and rarely used indoors or in confined spaces because it needed a lot of space to use effectively. Of most use against cavalry, the no-dachi was not a common blade, as it was harder to make than a shorter sword and required a strong man to swing it!</long_description>

<key>SHO_Sword_3_Master_Dojo_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nThe sword master school both improves the quality of sword-armed units recruited here and reduces the amount of time needed to train them. A sword takes many weeks of patient labour to forge, but the swordsman takes even longer. The sword is the soul of the samurai, and long hours of practice are necessary to master this apparently simple weapon.\n\nA kenjutsu school was more than a building: it was also the philosophy and ideas of its teachers and leaders, and each had its own style of combat and teaching. Although all schools shared the idea of kata, or forms, for practice, how these were used could vary greatly. Rivalry between schools was, at times, quite fierce, almost bordering on feuds, and duels to settle which school had the best style were not uncommon. The sword saint, Miyamoto Musashi, was, at one point in his career, particularly given to duelling with adepts from different schools. In his most famous duel he used a bokken, or wooden practice sword, against a man armed with a no-dachi. Accounts differ as to how his opponent, Sasaki Kojiro, died (and even as to why they fought) but all agree that Musashi beat him with a wooden blade!</long_description>

<key>SHO_Sword_4_Legendary_Dojo_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nThe legendary kenjutsu school allows the recruitment of hero units. It also greatly improves the quality of all sword-armed units recruited here. An experienced unit of katana samurai will always be present to defend their school. Finally, the first clan to construct this legendary school will gain a useful close combat bonus for their units. The correct use of the sword is one of the traditional marks of the samurai warrior class; the other is skill with the bow. A kenjutsu school of this quality is therefore a mark of great honour for a clan, as well as a practical benefit.\n\nMany martial arts, including kenjutsu, the art of swordplay, are based on a set of kata, or codified forms, meaning both moves and stances. These actions help the martial artist learn and perfect his skills in combat, to the point where he no longer has to think about his next move or response to an opponent. A particular school of martial arts can often be distinguished by the kata that it expounds, as well as by its underlying spiritual philosophy. \n\nIaijutsu, the “art of immediate reaction”, relies almost entirely on kata because its fast-draw sword techniques are usually practiced alone. Apart from anything else, it would be supremely dangerous to practice iaijutsu with a partner unless both participants were supremely skilled. Even then, death or dismemberment would come all too easily.</long_description>

<key>SHO_Yari_1_Drill_Yard_Description</key>
<long_description>\n\nThe drill yard allows the recruitment and training of yari-armed samurai units. Using a spear effectively in battle requires training, discipline and trust.\n\nThe art of using a spear, sojutsu, is one of many Japanese martial arts, and probably among the oldest. The spear was, with the bow, one of the traditional weapons of the samurai. The spear also has its place in Japanese mythology, because drops falling from the tip of ame-no-nuboko, the “Heavenly Jewelled Spear” formed the islands of Japan. This spear, however, is also referred to as a naginata, a slightly shorter slashing pole arm.\n\nThe spear came to be seen as a very cost-effective weapon for troops during the feudal wars of the Sengoku Jidai. Combined with bow and matchlock armed troops, spearmen formed the core of most clan armies. Spear fighting in Japan was a good deal more aggressive than the “push of pikes” that went on in European battles of roughly the same period. This probably reflected the more honour-bound and glory-hungry nature of Japanese warfare, as many European armies were full of mercenaries who could only be paid if they were still alive!</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThis dojo allows the recruitment of naginata-armed samurai units; if there is a large enough temple in the province, naginata-armed monks can also be trained. The naginata itself is a fearsome weapon, and requires considerable training to use effectively in battle. It is also a weapon favoured by samurai women for “home defence” when their men are on campaign. It should not, however, be considered in any way effeminate because of that!\n\nTo the untrained eye, the naginata looks like a spear with a wickedly sharp sword instead of a point. It can be used as a spear, of course, to thrust into an enemy or braced to receive a charge, but it is at its most effective when an adept uses it to cut and parry. Anyone facing a naginata has to deal with something that can cut and slash at a greater range than any sword, and be used to block any counterattack: the shaft is as much a part of the weapon’s strength as the blade itself! Traditionally, it was considered an extremely useful weapon against mounted enemies.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThis dojo speeds up the training of spear-armed troops. It also improves the expertise and experience of spear units trained in this province. Spears are traditional weapons and have been for centuries, but skilled men are needed to get the best from the weapons. Samurai spearmen bring their single-minded dedication to the weapon, but still need training.\n\nSojutsu, the art of the spear, is no longer a popular martial art in Japan, possibly because of the large amount of space needed for practice: kenjutsu, the art of the sword, needs far less room. Considered one of koryu, the traditional martial arts, the origins of sojutsu are lost in time, but it ceased to be taught on even a modest scale during the Meiji Restoration in 1866-9. Many schools were forced to close at that time, often after hundreds of years of continuous existence. The masters had relied on a rice stipend from the provinces to stay in business, and once that was gone the schools could no longer continue.</long_description>

Finally, if a clan constructs the first legendary sojutsu school in Japan all its yari-armed units receive a defensive bonus in battle.\n\nArming troops with spears reached the height of its popularity during and after the Mongol invasions of Japan. The Mongols themselves made extensive use of spearmen, and the Japanese were not slow to adapt and copy this style of warfare. During the Sengoku Jidai, spears were issued to the thousands of ashigaru troops in clan armies, as it was relatively easy to drill ashigaru in simple spear tactics: they need only hold together, brace their spears, and then push the enemy back! The samurai, however, continued to use sojutsu, and the best samurai spearmen were indeed a force to be reckoned with: brave, skilled, and committed to victory or death under the code of bushido. The same could not always be said of the ashigaru.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA cadet school allows the recruitment of modern units in a province. Training to be an officer takes a long time, and the best officers, the most dedicated professionals, are those who are trained from an early age to consider the army’s interests before their own. \n\nAs part of the efforts to modernise and professionalise armed forces, it was recognised in most countries that it made sense to teach young men the rudiments of military wisdom. As new guns and rifles arrived on the battlefield this became even more of an issue. In many countries officers had been trained by a sort of apprentice system, joining regiments directly as ensigns, cornets or junior lieutenants. While this was undoubtedly good for fostering strong bonds with their new units, it also meant that young officers also learned all the bad habits and prejudices of their senior colleagues. Only the seriously technical branches such as artillery and engineers avoided such problems by requiring officers to be educated.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA military academy, only available for construction in Kyoto itself, allows the recruitment of modern units in a province. Modern warfare is a highly technical business, and an officer needs far more than good breeding and a samurai ancestry to get the best from his men, although those do help of course. \n\nWestern armies were, haltingly, in the process of making their officer classes into professionals rather than the sons of gentry and the aristocracy. Not all great generals appreciated the benefits of military academy education: Robert E. Lee, the greatest general of the American Civil War, is reported to have said his military education was the worst mistake of his life. It was also possible to send the sons of titled gentry to an academy and leave them utterly immune to any intellectual process. Indeed, the British staff college at Camberley was so poorly regarded that it had only a handful of pupils in the 1850s. Certainly, the backgrounds (and mixed performances) of British commanders during the latter years of Victoria’s reign suggest that social class and connections were far more use in a successful career than an excess of thinking. Academies were nice to have, but that didn’t mean commanders had to attend them.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nAn army war college allows the recruitment of modern units in a province. Only one may be built. Warfare as an academic, intellectual challenge is the modern way; individual bravery is still of value, but the scientific approach to crushing an enemy has much to recommend it. \n\nWhen the Meiji government created a war college in 1882, they employed Prussian officers as teachers and to create a syllabus. By then, the Prussian military system had proven to be most effective, defeating both Austria and France in lightning-quick campaigns. Part of this effectiveness was attributed to the high professional standards of the senior Prussian officers, and it was these standards that the Japanese wanted to have in their army. In one sense, they did produce able men including several prime ministers, but fierce rivalry with the Imperial Japanese Navy was always source of tension and created competing national objectives.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA training camp reduces the expense of recruiting new units. Men can be efficiently trained, and cannot desert quite so readily from a well-ordered camp. \n\nAll armies need to train men in weapons handling, and toughen them for the rigours of campaign. Modern weaponry in particular can be intimidating to peasants unused to anything more complicated than the plough or the sickle. Gaining even rudimentary familiarity with something as alien as a foreign-built rifle takes time. On the other hand, such men are often quite hardy because they have lived a life outside, toiling in the fields. They need to learn, but their backs are already strong!

A good headquarters, in particular a well-organised supply effort, was vital to all operations. A medieval army, barring specialist weaponry, was able to take whatever it wanted or needed as it advanced through enemy territory. In contrast a 19th Century army would be hard-pressed to find enough food, let alone ammunition, by looting. Even something as simple as boots could be a problem: Confederate soldiers in the American Civil War were regularly reduced to looting boots, uniforms and equipment from dead Yankees.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA military hospital improves the replenishment rate for understrength units. Wounded men who are treated properly and promptly can often be returned to duty. \n\nMany European military hospitals, particularly those set up on campaign, were extremely badly run. During the Crimean War in the mid-1850s, for example, disease killed more British soldiers than the Russians, and anyone wounded in action faced a terrible, possibly fatal, time in hospital. This is what prompted Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole to improve medical care. During the American Civil War, field hospitals were often set up in stables as conveniently large buildings to shelter the wounded from the worst of the weather, but thanks to copious amounts of horse dung, not necessarily the best place to recover. Permanent hospitals were often better, but they were often far from the front, and could only care for survivors who lived through their immediate post-battle care.</long_description>

It was a set of techniques that evolved to use an opponent’s own weight and movements against them. Like most practical forms of infighting taught to soldiers, jujutsu was not about obeying the rules or being “fair” as is the case in modern martial arts. It was an “art” about killing or disabling an attacker quickly and with whatever was to hand: gouging and even biting an enemy were taught and used. As a way of fighting, it was exactly what you would expect of a system developed by samurai: effective, and deadly.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA drill school does much to remake recruits into obedient soldiers, willing to obey orders without thought. This improves their charge bonus into close combat. \n\nAll Victorian armies used weapons that required a mass of troops to work as one. From marching in formation to occupy land, to delivering accurate and disciplined volley fire, the rank and file were expected to be part of the regimental machine, not individuals. Some units did require individualism from the men, it is true, but for the most part strict adherence to orders and good discipline were required in battle and in barracks. Drill, endless drill, is one way of instilling instinctive obedience into recruits. If they are conditioned to obey orders on the drill square, they will be more inclined to do so in the heat of battle.</long_description>

This mild “baptism of fire” improves unit accuracy. \n\nMarksmanship was a completely wasted skill when infantry carried smoothbore muskets. An average infantryman was lucky to hit a target more than a few paces away. Industrialisation in the 19th Century made it possible to make rifled weapons at a low cost, and give one to every soldier in an army. All of a sudden, skill-at-arms, and in particularly paced, accurate firing, became a practical proposition. A trained man with a rifle could, with practice, reliably hit a man-sized target hundreds of yards away. The key requirement was practice, but a unit which had been properly trained, or had been blooded in action, could make any advancing foe pay dearly for every yard gained.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA military society is a “secret” organisation that encourages nationalist views in the population, and makes them happier in these times of change by giving them a sense of security. Usually membership is limited to officers, but wealthy civilians may contribute their support as well. The society’s membership is an open secret: everyone knows it exists, but no one actually talks about it, or ever claims to be a member. \n\nEventually military societies were to plague Japanese politics, and cause no end of misfortune to Japan and other countries. After the Great War, Japan entered a period when ultra-nationalist factions within the Imperial Japanese Army and the Navy professed enormous loyalty to the Emperor. Often these groups were middle and low-ranking officers, and they were quite prepared to assassinate both politicians and senior officers in their own services that they considered to be insufficiently loyal to the Imperial Throne. Any sign of compromise, social liberalism or free thinking was seen as base treachery to be punished with death at their hands. As might be expected, in such a febrile atmosphere, moderate politicians kept quiet. The military societies acted in zeal, but seemed unable to understand that others could be equally loyal and still hold different views as to what was best for Japan.

As the mine and its industries are developed and expanded, the ability to train modern units improves, and the cost of locally-recruited artillery units is reduced. \n\nIron is, perhaps, the most important war-making commodity needed by any modern state.

Goods can be swiftly transported to new markets, giving tremendous opportunities for growth. \n\nEven before the Meiji Restoration, the Satsuma domain and the Tokugawa Shogunate considered building railways. When work did start under Meiji orders, it was British engineers who got the rail-building contracts. Given Japan’s mountainous landscape, the decision to build a narrow gauge (3 feet 6 inches) railway system was probably a sensible one, as this allows for much tighter curves. Shipments of rails and rolling stock also seem to have been diverted from a line in New Zealand to Japan. Narrow gauge locos are also a good deal smaller than standard gauge ones, and therefore easier to offload from ships and manhandle! Other than the modern “Bullet Trains”, today’s fearsomely efficient Japanese railways continue to use this narrower gauge. \n\nThe telegraph, incidentally, was vital to the safe running of a railway because it could send warnings along the line that a train was coming. Among other dangerous practices, it had been usual to send trains off at the appointed time whether or not the line ahead was clear. All telegraph messages had to be sent in &quot;romaji&quot;, a version of Japanese written down using the English alphabet.

<long_description>\n\nAn inn is a place for entertainment, and for weary travellers to rest on their journeys. It increases the happiness of the local population and, as they can use their skills there, enables geishas to be recruited as agents. \n\nThe great Imperial roads of Japan had inns at regular intervals, allowing messengers to rest before pressing on with the Shogun’s business. Unfortunately, they also had a less salubrious side: drunken duels were not unknown, and gambling was also common. Geishas, however, did not provide any “personal services” to their clients: they were decorous escorts, not prostitutes. It was their part to make sure that everyone had a good time, drank a lot, ate excessively, and spent a lot of money at the inn.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA market allows any local traders and entrepreneurs to make money, so increasing economic activity in a province. Such income can, of course, be taxed. Given that market days are also chances to enjoy life, the skills of geisha are also in demand. Any geisha agents recruited in the same province will have some experience of life. \n\nMarkets are the centre of life in any town or agricultural community, a chance to get together, gossip, trade, and buy something special that can’t be made at home or by a neighbour. The peddlers who travelled between markets were seen as a necessary social class, but not held in much esteem. This dislike of outsiders and strangers was not particularly Japanese, but was echoed across the world in medieval times: tinkers and peddlers were welcome, but not trusted, and only for the duration of a market or festival. After that, sadly, they could expect short shrift.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA gambling den is a sink of vice and depravity, and also something that brings enormous enjoyment to those who frequent it. The local people are often happy, if only because the gamblers will protect them from other, worse types. The den also improves the local economy, even if the ruling classes see very little of this activity, at least officially. Geishas also polish their skills here, improving the quality of agents recruited in the same province. \n\nCriminality covered a number of social classes in Shogunate Japan, lumping people together as slightly unacceptable based on their jobs. Not quite the lowest of the low, bakuto were gamblers. They were held in contempt because they did not earn an honest living. Above them were hinin, criminals such as actors and entertainers; again, they did not have respectable trades. Even ordinary townsfolk, the chonin, were held to be less than respectable compared to the peasants, simply because they did not labour on the land.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA financial district brings together moneylenders, loan sharks and rich merchants into one community that engages in the delicate business of lending money to others. Trade and commerce are improved throughout the province, as merchants can more easily finance their trading activities. Because these men have large amounts of money to spend on their entertainments, the quality of geishas recruited in the same province will be improved. \n\nWithout a structure of property laws, all financial dealings are necessarily about the given word of the lender and borrower. Because of this, the lender often expects a very good return on his money; after all, short of going after repayments with threats of violence, there may be no way of recovering his funds. Legally enforceable contracts, even though they involve expensive lawyers, can actually make the business of borrowing money cheaper: the lender has a good expectation of seeing all of his money back, and can charge a smaller fee or less interest for its use.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThis hotbed of criminality and gambling improves happiness in the province. It also gives geishas a chance to practice their skills, and so adds experience to any recruited here. \n\nMahjong (“Sparrow Tiles” in the original Chinese) looks complicated, but is actually remarkably simple in principle, and ruthless in practice. Played with 136 ivory tiles, four players try to form matching groups of four tiles until “Mahjong” is called, gambling on the result as they do so. Based on an older Chinese card game, Ma-Taio, the Japanese embraced the game and made it a little more cutthroat. Richi Mahjong adds a winner-takes-all element that makes the game more of a race to victory. While gambling is now illegal in Japan, Richi Mahjong was once the perfect game for high-stakes excitement.</long_description>

However, by investing in bigger and deeper mines, it is possible to greatly increase the wealth generated by this province. Gold is, of course, always welcome to any warlord because all wise commanders know that wars cannot be fought, let alone won, without wealth. \n\nGold mining is a dirty and dangerous business for the miners and surface workers.

The building improves happiness in a province, and also improves the quality of geishas recruited there. After all, bankers must have their small pleasures. \n\nCompared to medieval merchants, all modern industries and businesses make extensive use of banking services. In the rapidly modernising Japan of the Meiji period, the city of Osaka became a centre for banking, with much of the work of a central bank being done by the “Junin Ryogae”, the Ten Exchange Houses. Although these were not modern bankers, they did lend money to other banks, the governments of individual domains, and manage the markets of gold-back cash and silver-backed bank-issue money. In effect, they controlled the exchange and interest rates for Japan.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA yakuza office may not be an entirely legal business, but it is a business and it does improve the commercial activity in a province. The protection extended by the yakuza also improves the happiness of the local people, and improves the quality of geisha recruited in the same province. Only one yakuza office can be built. \n\nThe yakuza can trace their origins back to two groups: peddlers and gamblers. Nobles and samurai were at the top of the social hierarchy. Oddly, townsfolk of all kinds ranked below “honest” peasants, and itinerant traders were considered even lower. They were forced to gang together to protect themselves during markets. Gamblers were similarly considered of very low status, but they had access to money, and often acted as loan sharks and informal financiers. The yakuza, then, were united in the face of social scorn, but behaved with considerable decorum towards each other. Even today, and unlike many organised criminals, they rarely attack people outside “the life”.</long_description>

They also come to feel that property is safe, and that wrongdoers will be punished. It improves the quality of agents recruited in the same province. \n\nPolicing was often an ad hoc business, carried out by a lord’s retainers as and when it was required. Justice, in a society where a samurai was pretty much free to kill anyone he wanted provided they were from a lower social class, was swift and summary. Towns and cities had city watches, groups of men paid to patrol the streets at night and during festivals, but these were as much concerned with fire-watching as thief-taking; fire, of course, was always a terrible danger in the close-packed wooden buildings of many towns.</long_description>

It is a foolish man indeed who crosses a magistrate, and a foolishly brave one who does so deliberately. He is, then, a tool of legal repression in human form. He also knows his province and can spot men of talent, making it easier to recruit agents. \n\nAfter the lawlessness of the Sengoku Jidai, the strongest reasons for ordinary people to support the Tokugawa Shogunate were law and order. With peace came the chance to build settled lives, safe from pillage, rapine and murder. Shogunate officials were quick to capitalise on this history during the struggle of the Meiji Restoration, although direct criticism of the Emperor was, of course, completely beyond the pale. The motive of his servants, lawless as they were and without respect for tradition, could be called into question with impugnity.</long_description>

Mostly, and particularly within the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army after the Meiji Restoration, these groups were very nationalistic and uncompromising in their outlook, and all professed a fierce loyalty to the Emperor. Their targets were usually intellectuals, liberals and compromisers (or realists) who, in their view, were not serving the Emperor or Japan properly. Unfortunately, rather than arguing their cases in open, often assassination became the secret societies’ favoured tool of political discourse.</long_description>

Often drawn from the ranks of ronin, impartial observers would probably have trouble in distinguishing between protection racketeers and the squads of special police. \n\nThe use by the Shogun of the shinsengumi was probably little more than a recognition that troublemakers were going to cause trouble. It was therefore better to have some control over them than none at all, particularly as these men were largely traditionalists at heart. It was inevitable that Japan modernised in the face of foreign intervention or domination, and reactionary forces had to be kept in check somehow.

In the process, of course, the justifications of rebels and traitors are shown to be lies, which helps make the local population certain of where their loyalties should lie. The office also helps with the recruitment of ishin-shishi. \n\nThe “men of high purpose” of the ishin-shishi were the most vociferous supporters of the Emperor, and used history and tradition to justify their viewpoint. Oddly, the “historical office” or shikoyoku had been established by the Tokugawas to formalise the study of Japanese history. But tradition can be used by more than one group of people, and the ishin-shishi used the historical record with more skill. Clever use of history did, however, mean that the Shogun’s supporters could be reconciled to the Emperor’s final triumph. It was not, after all, new, but a return to an older tradition; even the Shogun’s servants had always been loyal to the Imperial throne.</long_description>

They did not treat people with different loyalties with any great respect or courtesy.

The quality of any ishin-shishi recruited is improved by a newspaper. \n\nMeiji-period Japanese newspapers were initially intended to be for foreigners, and largely containing foreign news. There had been Japanese news sheets since the 1700s but they were, as might be expected, closely monitored by the government. When the newspapers were produced with Japanese news and content, they soon divided into “broadsheets” and “tabloids”, acting respectively as political propaganda for various parties and interest groups, and sources of more general lightweight news and entertainment. Neither sort of paper survived intact to the end of the century, and Japan developed a fairly healthy free press that tried to report impartially. This state of affairs lasted until the rise of militarism and the imposition of heavy-handed government censorship.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nCottage industry adds to the wealth of a province. The craftsmen use traditional methods, but do so very efficiently and in close cooperation with merchants and traders. Their goods can be sold in many places, even though each man may only make a few items. \n\nHistory shows that cottage industries are the natural precursor to an industrial revolution. Each weaver, potter or smith may work in his own shop, but with many of them in a small area, they can produce large quantities of goods even though their machinery is not mechanised or modernised. Each family tends to specialise in one part of craft process, so that a potter will make pottery, which is then sold on to a decorator or painter, and in turn sold on when fired to a merchant. There is, in effect, a production line, but one split across small workshops. While this meant that craftsmen could make more goods and so more money, they were not in a position to compete against water or steam-powered factories and their enormous outputs. The same pattern of craftsmen being driven out of markets and overwhelmed by the relatively cheap goods from factories was repeated in Japan. As with the original Industrial Revolution, many craftsmen were forced to take work in the new factories, or face starvation.</long_description>

Silver can be found as nuggets or, as it is reactive and unlike gold, as compounds with other elements. It is also a by-product of other kinds of mining, either from the tailings or because silver is often found in the same rock strata. This can make silver mining or recovery a hazardous business for the workers, as lead or arsenic poisoning are horrible ways to die. \n\nNevertheless, silver is an attractive metal, and has been long valued and used by people as coinage and jewellery. It has also had medical uses, both for instruments and as a treatment for a variety of complaints. Before the arrival of modern antibiotics, it was recognised that silver could treat some infections; this is because the metal is toxic to some microbes and fungi.

Access to cotton is required before the shed can be built. \n\nAlmost without exception, craft looms are powered by the craftsman, or craftswoman, making the cloth. The work is, as a result, physically quite hard. Power looms, first developed in England in the early 1700s were less tiring to use. They were first driven by waterwheels, and only later by coal-fired steam engines. The first mills built were all on hillsides in Northern England, precisely to take advantage of the force of water when it flows downhill. Japan, whatever else it may lack, does not suffer from a shortage of steep hillsides! Simple power looms are therefore easy to install.</long_description>

Their days were marked by the passing of the seasons, and the position of the sun.

Cotton and woollen mills in England had, by 1850, contributed a huge amount to the wealth of the nation and encouraged a second wave of industrial innovation in railways, shipping and machine making. Across the Atlantic, “King Cotton”, and the demand for raw cotton from slave-owning American states, helped convince the Confederate States of America that they could secede and pay for a war.

It is, however, a rather old-fashioned structure, but a design that has stood the test of time. \n\nStone was used in Japanese castles and strongholds to create sturdy foundations, something that was important in a nation so beset by earthquakes. Wherever possible Japanese castle builders preferred to use the landscape to create a formidable defence, but often it was necessary to make a stone platform for a castle. This would then support an impressive collection of tiered towers and walls, a sign of both wealth and military might.

<long_description>\n\nAlthough old-fashioned, a fortress is a clear symbol of power and dominance, and serves to repress any local dissent. It also helps recruitment in a province. \n\nTraditionally, most fortresses in Japan had been constructed from stout timbers, but this policy had changed during the Sengoku Jidai, when siege engines were widely used. Most fortresses, though, had old roots, as the strategic importance of where they were in the landscape did not change over the centuries: what was difficult to assault in 1400 remained so in 1600, and in 1850. Fortresses traditionally relied on a layered approach for their defence, making any attack time - and manpower - consuming. Despite this design philosophy, it was not unusual for the defenders to open the gates and charge the enemy, regardless of the odds, if this was judged to be the best way of upsetting the enemy’s plans.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nAlthough somewhat old-fashioned, a castle represents power as it looms over the homes of the peasantry; this alone helps suppress dissent. The castle also acts as a recruitment centre in a province. \n\nDuring the Sengoku Jidai, castles were the homes of the great provincial lords, the daimyo. Under the Tokugawa Shogunate, castles remained homes, but lost much of their practical use as fortresses. It would be a foolish enemy indeed who laid siege to a castle, given that at least one close member of an attacker’s family would be held hostage at the Shogun’s pleasure. There was little reason, then, to be afraid of open attack, although assassination remained a constant concern, even under the Tokugawas. \n\nCastles were expensive, though, and a good way of flaunting family wealth without openly counting the contents of the treasury. A great deal of prestige was gained by tasteful patronage of arts and crafts, both to beautify the fabric of the building and as objects to display within.</long_description>

Seen from above, they really are star-shaped. Essentially, the design was a fortress was sunk into the ground, presenting a low silhouette, with a surrounding glacis, or slope, to deflect shots over the top of the fortifications. The slope might seem an easy approach for attacking infantry, but a ring of projecting points allowed the defenders to fire along the length of the walls. Any defenders who reached the top of the glacis then had to cross a deep dry moat, all the while under heavy fire. A star fort was intended as a killing ground, pure and simple.</long_description>

As navies modernise, however, the need for support facilities ashore becomes pressing. Repairs to a wooden vessel could often be carried out by the ship’s crew; the same is not true of modern ironclads. Even the simplest job may mean that the ship has to return to port for specialist attention. The need for coaling stations is another “infrastructure” problem for a modernising navy. In the old days, the wind did not need to be loaded aboard before a voyage took place!

After 1633 Japanese traders had been forbidden to go abroad, and foreigners had been confined to Nagasaki, but foreign books and the ideas they contained were still circulated. The Japanese kept up with European scientific, political and military developments through Dutch booksellers, and this contributed to their realistic appraisal of what opening up trade with the West might mean. A clear understanding of what had been happening overseas helped the Japanese to leap from the late medieval world to a modern one in less than 50 years.</long_description>

For shipbuilding purposes, a vessel can be constructed and then the dock flooded, allowing the vessel to be towed out. Ships for repair can be floated in at high tide through lock gates; the pond is then pumped dry while the ships are propped up on supports. The main drawback of a drydock is the initial cost and its capacity. In effect, it becomes the limiting factor on the size of new ships.

The treaty was more than a little one-sided in terms of what the Americans got. Like the other treaties Japan signed, it reflected the balance of power between the closed, backward Japan and the industrialised, colonial nations of the West. These were a spur to Japanese modernisation efforts and, by 1900, Japan could be counted a developed, modern nation in many ways: Japanese troops fought alongside European soldiers during the Boxer Rebellion in China, for example.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA French trading district improves the port defences in several ways, and improves the value of exports to the outside world. \n\nThe Second Opium War (1856-60) gave the Japanese a concrete example of what could happen if European powers, in this case Britain and France, decided to use force. China was forced to make extensive trade concessions by the war, including legalising the opium trade, granting “favoured nation” trading status to her attackers and opening up ports to effective European control. Quite sensibly, the Japanese wanted nothing like it to happen to them. During the years of the Opium War, the Japanese agreed to a series of treaties that, while unfair, were distinctly better than handing over complete control to foreigners.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nSubsistence farms provide a basic agricultural income, and can help industry grow by providing food to the workers. \n\nRelatively small-scale farming will feed the people adequately in most years, but it allows little excess to support a workforce away from the farm. Even in medieval-pattern societies, a reliable food surplus is necessary to support skilled craftsmen, and even warriors. If the surplus fails, then starvation and economic disaster soon follow, as craftsmen move to where they can find food. Peasants, being tied to the land rather than having marketable skills, do not have such an option.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nSilver mining can be enormously profitable, and additional investment in this province will bring in extra, taxable income. Silver can be found as nuggets or, as it is reactive and unlike gold, as compounds with other elements. It is also a by-product of other kinds of mining, either from the tailings or because silver is often found in the same rock strata. This can make silver mining or recovery a hazardous business for the workers, as lead or arsenic poisoning are horrible ways to die. \n\nNevertheless, silver is an attractive metal, and has been long valued and used by people as coinage and jewellery. It has also had medical uses, both for instruments and as a treatment for a variety of complaints. Before the arrival of modern antibiotics, it was recognised that silver could treat some infections; this is because the metal is toxic to some microbes and fungi. The medical benefits, though, are entirely outweighed by its use as treasure.</long_description>

Instead, they pay rent on their lands, and this means that they become part of the larger, cash economy of the land. This may sound trivial, but it is important because it boosts trade activity, and gives common people a way of accumulating wealth. A subsistence farmer can never be “wealthier” than having too much food to eat; a man who sells his goods can accumulate a surplus of wealth over many harvests, and use it as he wishes.

Such was the demand for workers in England’s Industrial Revolution, not to mention the profiteering of many factory owners, that entire families left the land and worked in factories.

<long_description>\n\nMatchlock towers improve defences by allowing the defenders to pepper attacking soldiers with heavy, if somewhat slow, gunfire. \n\nMatchlocks are a very simple kind of firearms, with smoothbore barrels and a very simple firing mechanism. They are muzzle-loaders, which means that powder and ball must be rammed down the barrel, and a pan at the breech end of the barrel, with a small hole to main charge, primed with gunpowder. This is quite risky for the firer, as the match is a slow-burning cord, soaked in flammable chemicals: gunpowder and fire do not mix terribly well in the hands of the careless! When the trigger is pulled, the match, held by a lever, is touched to the pan. The priming catches, the fire flashes through to the breech, and the gun goes off. In wet conditions, this doesn’t always happen. In dry conditions it may not work either, and the gunner is left with the ticklish business of re-priming his matchlock, not knowing whether it will suddenly go off in his face, a “hang fire”. It is not surprising that matchlocks were abandoned in most of the world in favour of flintlocks and then percussion cap weapons. Modern firearms avoid all these problems by using a cartridge that integrates primer, powder charge, and bullet in one waterproof unit.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nTokugawa Ieyasu, the eventual victor in the wars of the Sengoku Jidai, created five great roads all leading from Edo, his capital. The roads were, of course, a tool of control, as they allowed to his armies to move swiftly to crush any opposition to his rule. While this was a worthwhile reason for keeping them in use for 250 years, they soon became vital to internal trade. Over the decades, the Tokugawa Shogunate made sure that travel was controlled by a series of post stations along the roads’ length. While travellers could rest, they were also carefully watched. The roads remained vital, even after the Meiji Restoration, and their paths had been chosen so well that the new-fangled railways came to follow much the same route!</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA traditional dojo trains young men in the skills required of the samurai. It enables the recruitment of “old fashioned” units and agents. \n\nThe word “dojo” means “the place of the way”; it is a formal setting for a particular art, not even necessarily combat related. For samurai extensive training and constant practice was absolutely necessary, and a dojo of some kind was almost required, even if this was only a courtyard set aside for the work. While all swords require skill from the user, the katana makes greater demands than other weapons. Kenjutsu, the art of using a sword, could take decades to truly master. More relevant to the samurai of the Tokugawa Shogunate were specialised skills such as iaijutsu, a self-defence technique of drawing and striking with the sword in the same instant. This skill had forms that could be used in defence even when sitting down to dinner!</long_description>

It enables the recruitment of units and agents of the traditional, Japanese kind. \n\nEven after centuries of peace, samurai were the only class in Japanese society allowed to carry arms as a matter of duty. Indeed, they were required to wear a pair of swords precisely as a public declaration of their social class. \n\nDespite the lack of warfare, and possibly because they had no genuine need to act like warriors, the samurai remained jealous of keeping their perquisites and privileges. There was a determination to keep their skills current, and to make sure that new generations learned them. The relentless march of the hob-nailed future that Europeans and Americans brought only made some more determined than ever to keep to the old ways. </long_description>

It had suited the Shoguns to keep the samurai busy with mastering the old skills of swordsmanship, but they had put an equal emphasis on the more “gentlemanly” skills of the arts. The samurai, as a class, were still influential but it is a fair judgement to say that their war skills had been blunted by disuse, even as individuals mastered their weapons skills.</long_description>

It enables the recruitment of better, more experienced units and agents of the traditional kind. \n\nFor many samurai, a new Japan represented a terrible, cruel challenge. By training and tradition they were entirely unsuited to earning a living in trade or, worse still, manual labour. Centuries of peace had not changed their essential nature as warriors, first, foremost, and exclusively. Even with nearly 250 years of peace, their training had not altered much; they were expected to have the accomplishments of gentlemen, and to fight. This was why so many stuck to the ways they had learned in the dojo, and why so many rebelled against the future.</long_description>

Infantry might take and hold ground, cavalry pursue enemies and lend a touch of class to the vulgarity, but it was artillery that did the heavy work when destroying the enemy. This truth remained, even as infantry were given rifles rather than smoothbores: even though infantrymen could now kill their foes at great distances, artillery had developed too. Rifled artillery barrels and explosive shells had become standard issue. Artillery remained the most “technical” of the branches of army service, and the one that, arguably, benefitted most from modern industrial practices.</long_description>

Fortress guns were usually too large to be moved once in position. With the Victorian era obsession with the new, novel and bigger-as-better, artillery rapidly became larger and larger. However, there was a constant design compromise to be made between better firepower, and that meant an increase in size, and the need to be able to move guns to, and on, the battlefield. It was possible to make field guns in enormous calibres, but completely pointless as no horse team would ever be able to move them into action!</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nAn artillery academy allows the training of artillery units. \n\nArtillery was an aspect of military technology that benefitted from the rapid industrialisation of almost everything during the 19th Century. Industry put new tools into the hands of artillery officers: better guns, new ammunition, cheap telescopes, revolvers for personal defence and, best of all, new ways of reliably using artillery. It was now possible to use indirect fire with a good deal of precision. Direct fire was the traditional way of using heavy guns: firing at enemies that could be seen in front of the artillery position. With indirect fire, the guns fired blind into an area where the enemy were, and had their aim adjusted by a forward observer. This demanded new techniques of co-operation, and a good deal of training for all the soldiers involved.</long_description>

It was in the middle of the 19th Century that the great arms makers of Europe really industrialised the business of making and selling guns. The great arsenals at places like Woolwich in England continued to be important, but it was the engineering works of men like William Armstrong and Alfred Krupp that revolutionised the building of guns. In 1847 Alfred Krupp of Essen, Germany, made his first cast steel gun. Four years later, he was exhibiting weapons at the Great Exhibition in London. \n\nThe French, as is so often the case with new technology, had been masters of artillery for years; their Gribeauval system of standardised barrels and carriages had contributed to the success of French artillery a hundred years earlier. It had also helped Napoleon Bonaparte nearly conquer the whole of Europe.</long_description>
