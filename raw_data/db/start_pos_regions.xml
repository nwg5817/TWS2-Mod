<long_description>Echigo is a moderately wealthy province located to the north of Honshu. During the Sengoku Jidai, Echigo was ruled by Uesugi Kenshin, a great warlord who became famous for his long rivalry with Takeda Shingen. Kenshin had lived in Echigo all his life and was originally called Nagao Kagetora, but he changed his name when he was adopted into the Uesugi clan. It was also in Echigo that nishikigoi, the colourful variety of the common carp that are now commonplace as pets, were first produced through selective breeding.</long_description>

<long_description>Etchu, located in the west of Honshu, is a coastal province plagued by frequent flooding. This proved detrimental to rice cultivation and agriculture until irrigation networks were established during the Edo period. Because of its strategic position, Etchu was the site of many battles throughout history, including the Battle of Kurikara. This marked the turning point in the Gempei War, when the Minamoto victory cleared the way for their undisputed rise to power and the establishment of the first Shogunate.</long_description>

<long_description>Harima is a wealthy province situated in the south of Honshu. Its location by the Akashi Strait makes it an important source of seafood. The province is famed for Akashiyaki, a form of fried octopus dumpling. The legendary Forty-seven Ronin hailed from the castle town of Ako in Harima. After their lord was forced to commit seppuku for assaulting a member of the Shogunate who had slighted him, these masterless samurai bided their time before taking revenge upon the man who caused their master’s dishonour and death.</long_description>

<long_description>Higo is situated on the west coast of Kyushu. Its fertile soil and mild climate makes it an agriculturally rich province. An impressive and well-constructed castle was built in the provincial capital of Kumamoto during the late sixteenth century. It was supposed to be impregnable, but it finally fell to an attack during the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, although many of its buildings survived.</long_description>

<long_description>Located in westernmost Tokaido, Iga province is home to the Iga Sokoku Ikki, a group of minor clans - including the Hattori - and the founders of the Iga school of ninjutsu. Their formidable ninjutsu skills, combined with their intimate knowledge of the mountainous terrain, allowed the Iga families to maintain their independence for many years. They were almost destroyed when Oda Nobunaga invaded Iga in 1581, although many escaped and survived to serve Tokugawa Ieyasu when he rose to power.</long_description>

<long_description>On the northwest coast of Chubu, Inaba’s numerous lakes and marshes make it ideal for the cultivation of rice. The provincial capital of Tottori derives its name from the term Tottoribe, meaning “one who catches birds”. This stems from the extensive hunting of water birds in the area, during a period of Japanese history when the Imperial Court ordered that fowl were to be handed over as tax.</long_description>

<long_description>Located in the north of Kanto, Kozuke is a fertile province whose cooler climate makes it ideal for the cultivation of highland vegetables. It is famed for the production of konyaku, a plant used in the creation of flour and jelly. Now called Gunma prefecture, it is the home to one of Japan's three 'Melody Roads'. This stretch of road features grooves which create vibrations within a car's body when they are driven over. They are cunningly cut to produce the tune of “Memories of Summer”!</long_description>

<long_description>Situated on the Tokai coast, Mikawa is a moderately wealthy area, and the ancestral fief of the Matsudaira clan. Matsudaira Takechiyo would later adopt the name Tokugawa Ieyasu and rise to become Seii Taishogun, the “great commander who subdues barbarians”. The Tokugawa clan ruled as Shoguns for more than 200 years. Today, Mikawa is famed for the production of fireworks, a result of an order from the Tokugawa Shogunate that the province should be the sole source of gunpowder in Japan.</long_description>

<long_description>Mino is situated in the heart of Honshu, a great and fertile plain surrounded by mountains. A strategically important location owing to its central position, it was often thought that holding the provincial capital of Gifu was the key to victory. Mino province was the site of the hugely important Battle of Sekigahara, which resulted in a Tokugawa victory over the Toyotomi. This battle secured Tokugawa Ieyasu's position, and made his rise to ultimate power almost inevitable.</long_description>

<long_description>Nagasaki, on the south coast of Kyushu, was an early centre of trade with the Portuguese during the 16th Century. As a result of this, it has a large Christian population. Banned under the policy of Sakoku, Catholicism was forced underground during the 17th Century. The Tokugawa Shogunate of the day even went so far as to deport the children of Japanese-European liaisons. Trade is key to the wealth of the province, and smuggling is also commonplace.</long_description>

<long_description>Fertile and humid, Nagato is located on the western-most tip of Honshu, Japan’s main island. Many famous battles have taken place here, such as the sea battle of Dan-no-Ura between the Minamoto and the Taira; on a smaller scale, Nagato was where the duel between the sword masters Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojiro happened. Due to its long coast, fish is the main foodstuff, and the area is famous for fugu, the meat of the Japanese blowfish. Unfortunately for some unlucky diners, fugu is extremely poisonous if not prepared properly!</long_description>

It is also known for the Koga-ryu, a school of ninjutsu from the Koka area. With its closeness to Kyoto, the old Imperial capital, Omi was an important location. When the capital moved to Edo, it became host to a series of post stations along the Tokaido road between the two cities.</long_description>

<long_description>Together with Satsuma, Osumi forms the most southerly part of Japan, excluding the Ryukyu Islands. It has many active volcanoes, with Sakurajima being the most unstable. The volcanic soil and frequent ash deposits actually make the place rather fertile. The island of Tanegashima, where the Portugese captain Mendes Pinto was stranded in 1543, belongs to the Osumi Islands. For a long time all muskets were called “tanegashima”, as gunpowder in Japan was thought to originate from here.</long_description>

<long_description>Situated on the north coast of Shikoku, Sanuki has always had good links to the main islands. Although it is not a wealthy province, its quarries can be a major economic asset. Kukai, the founder of the Shingon branch of Japanese Buddhism, was born and raised here, while the deity of scholarship, Sugawara no Michizane, wrote much of his poetry while governing Sanuki. The province also claims to be the first to adopt udon, the famous noodle dish. Today, Sanuki is the Kagawa prefecture, and is home to one of Japan’s most beautiful traditional gardens.</long_description>

<long_description>Sapporo is the largest province in the south of Ezo island. Rich in coal and home to a large native Ainu population, canals were built across the central Ishikari Plain during the 1860s in order to transport the mined ores to the coast. The plain containing Sapporo is unusual in that it is a rare example of well-drained, flat land on an island of mountainous peaks.</long_description>

<long_description>Satsuma is a wealthy province on the southern end of Kyushu. Home to the Shimazu clan, it has a long and impressive swordsmithing tradition. Its remote location and good trading links make it a good place for foreign trade. The Shimazu ruled the area for a long time, and can be considered one of the most successful clans. They conquered the Ryukyu kingdom, managed to gain various exceptions from Shogunate rule, and had major influence within the Meiji government.</long_description>

<long_description>Settsu is not a farming province, but its proximity to the capital and its Inland Sea port makes it very valuable. As a relatively urbanized province with a fairly substantial middle class it is also a place of administration and learning. It is also home to the oldest temple in Japan and to the rebellious and troublesome Ikko-Ikki. Today Osaka, the provincial capital, is the financial hub of Japan and has the headquarters of many well-known companies, such as Panasonic and Capcom. Osaka Castle is a prominent tourist destination, and the city’s inhabitants are well known for both their cuisine and distinctive dialect.</long_description>

<long_description>Located in the centre of the “Japanese Alps”, the Shinano province is as mountainous as might be expected. It is therefore difficult to farm. In all of Japan, it is the province furthest from the sea in all directions. Stone is extensively quarried.

Under the Ouchi family, the capital Yamaguchi has become known as the “Kyoto of the West” due to its great cultural achievements, making it the unofficial second city of Japan. It was here, among the educated population, that Francis Xavier, the famed Jesuit missionary, found patronage and support for his attempts to convert the Japanese to Catholicism.</long_description>

<long_description>Being mainly mountains, Suruga is not well suited to farming. The capital, Sumpu, is the main stronghold of the Imagawa clan and has a long tradition of political bickering. Tokugawa Ieyasu apparently retired to Suruga, although he quietly set up a second court to continue his rule out of the public gaze. The last Shogun, Yoshinobu, also came to Suruga to retire, but was refused permission to live at Sumpu Castle by the newly-restored Meiji regime. </long_description>

Though it doesn’t produce a large income, it has the advantage of its position, as it is a gateway between the coastal areas separated by the Chugoku Mountains. Nowadays, Tajima has gained global fame for being the birthplace of Kobe beef. Made from Wagyu cattle that are bred and reared following strict tradition, it is widely regarded as a delicacy and, possibly, the best beef in the world.</long_description>

<long_description>Tanegashima is an island off the coast of the province of Osumi in Kyushu. It is famous for the manufacture of scissors, knives, and other edged tools, including many small precision pieces ideal for the care of Bonsai trees. After Fernao Mendes Pinto, the Portuguese explorer, introduced guns to Japan, they were manufactured on Tanegashima from 1542. In fact, guns were colloquially known as “Tanega-shima” for many years due to the belief that they were first manufactured there and not in foreign parts.</long_description>

<long_description>Tsukushi is in the heart of Kyushu, and is an extremely rich province. The city of Dazaifu is one of the major military and administrative centres of feudal Japan. Historically, Tsukushi was where foreign embassies, including that of the Chinese, could be found. Sugawara no Michizane, a scholar who was deified as the Kami of learning, spent his final years here in exile. Today, the capital is Fukuoka, the most populous city on Kyushu. It is also one of Japan’s most dynamic cities.</long_description>

<long_description>Ugo is a fertile province, and its remote location in the far northwest helps keep it a very rural place. It produces mainly sake, vegetables and building stone. Nowadays it is part of the Akita prefecture and still famous for the production of sake, along with the drinking of sake. Some claim it is home to the most beautiful women in all of Japan, although is that the sake speaking? It is also home to Ono no Komachi, one of Japan’s most famous female poets and, according to Catholic tradition, the Virgin Mary once appeared there as well.</long_description>

<long_description>Wakasa province lies on the western coast, between Wakasa Bay and Lake Biwa. While relatively small and underdeveloped, it is a crossroads of major routes, making it of some strategic value. The area is well known for its fishing, and provides much of Kyoto’s seafood. Its capital, Obama, gained some fame-by-association in 2008 due to it sharing the name with the new American president, Barack Obama. The ensuing craze resulted in Hula groups, Obama candy, and other such merchandise.</long_description>

<long_description>Kyoto is capital of the small province of Yamashiro: it is the spiritual, intellectual and administrative centre of Japan. Both the Ashikaga Shogun and the Emperor reside here, and holding Yamashiro should be the main objective for any daimyo aspiring to subdue and rule Japan. Even today, Kyoto has retained its status as the heart of traditional Japanese culture. With its numerous shrines, temples and cultural events it is the second most popular tourist destination in Japan, receiving over thirty million visitors each year.</long_description>

<long_description>Located in the rich Japanese heartland and bordering Kyoto, Yamato is a valuable asset for its owners. Yamato gives its name to the earliest Japanese empire, which originated here, and Todai-ji, Japan’s largest temple, can be found here. The word “Yamato” is often used in conjunction with subjects and values that are seen as traditionally very Japanese: it has a deep resonance in the culture. This was why the largest warship (other than modern aircraft carriers) ever constructed was the Imperial Japanese Navy’s Yamato, a 73,000 ton super-battleship armed with 410mm guns. The ship saw only limited action in the Second World War, and was sunk by US aircraft in April 1945. The great vessel capsized and then exploded; the captain and commanding admiral went down with their ship.</long_description>

Kenshin had lived in Echigo all his life and was originally called Nagao Kagetora, but he changed his name when he was adopted into the Uesugi clan. It was also in Echigo that nishikigoi, the colourful variety of the common carp that are now commonplace as pets, were first produced through selective breeding.</long_description>

<long_description>Etchu, located in the west of Honshu, is a coastal province plagued by frequent flooding. This proved detrimental to rice cultivation and agriculture until irrigation networks were established during the Edo period. Because of its strategic position, Etchu was the site of many battles throughout history, including the Battle of Kurikara. This marked the turning point in the Gempei War, when the Minamoto victory cleared the way for their undisputed rise to power and the establishment of the first Shogunate.</long_description>

<long_description>Harima is a wealthy province situated in the south of Honshu. Its location by the Akashi Strait makes it an important source of seafood. The province is famed for Akashiyaki, a form of fried octopus dumpling. The legendary Forty-seven Ronin hailed from the castle town of Ako in Harima. After their lord was forced to commit seppuku for assaulting a member of the Shogunate who had slighted him, these masterless samurai bided their time before taking revenge upon the man who caused their master’s dishonour and death.</long_description>

<long_description>Located in westernmost Tokaido, Iga province is home to the Iga Sokoku Ikki, a group of minor clans - including the Hattori - and the founders of the Iga school of ninjutsu. Their formidable ninjutsu skills, combined with their intimate knowledge of the mountainous terrain, allowed the Iga families to maintain their independence for many years. They were almost destroyed when Oda Nobunaga invaded Iga in 1581, although many escaped and survived to serve Tokugawa Ieyasu when he rose to power.</long_description>

<long_description>On the northwest coast of Chubu, Inaba’s numerous lakes and marshes make it ideal for the cultivation of rice. The provincial capital of Tottori derives its name from the term Tottoribe, meaning “one who catches birds”. This stems from the extensive hunting of water birds in the area, during a period of Japanese history when the Imperial Court ordered that fowl were to be handed over as tax.</long_description>

<long_description>Kii is a wealthy province situated on the coast southwest of Kyoto in central Honshu. The mild and temperate climate makes it well suited for farming, and the area produces much fruit, notably mandarins, persimmons and peaches. Today the area is one of the major lacquerware production centres of Japan. Monks living at Negoro-ji started the craft during the Muromachi period.</long_description>

<long_description>Located in the north of Kanto, Kozuke is a fertile province whose cooler climate makes it ideal for the cultivation of highland vegetables. It is famed for the production of konyaku, a plant used in the creation of flour and jelly. Now called Gunma prefecture, it is the home to one of Japan's three 'Melody Roads'. This stretch of road features grooves which create vibrations within a car's body when they are driven over. They are cunningly cut to produce the tune of “Memories of Summer”!</long_description>

<long_description>Situated on the Tokai coast, Mikawa is a moderately wealthy area, and the ancestral fief of the Matsudaira clan. Matsudaira Takechiyo would later adopt the name Tokugawa Ieyasu and rise to become Seii Taishogun, the “great commander who subdues barbarians”. The Tokugawa clan ruled as Shoguns for more than 200 years. Today, Mikawa is famed for the production of fireworks, a result of an order from the Tokugawa Shogunate that the province should be the sole source of gunpowder in Japan.</long_description>

<long_description>Mimasaka is a, indeed the only, landlocked province in southern Chugoku. Thanks to its mountain, it has little farming, but the area is rich in iron deposits. The provincial capital Tsuyama is best known today for its outstanding Cherry Blossom Festival.

<long_description>Mino is situated in the heart of Honshu, a great and fertile plain surrounded by mountains. A strategically important location owing to its central position, it was often thought that holding the provincial capital of Gifu was the key to victory. Mino province was the site of the hugely important Battle of Sekigahara, which resulted in a Tokugawa victory over the Toyotomi. This battle secured Tokugawa Ieyasu's position, and made his rise to ultimate power almost inevitable.</long_description>

<long_description>Fertile and humid, Nagato is located on the western-most tip of Honshu, Japan’s main island. Many famous battles have taken place here, such as the sea battle of Dan-no-Ura between the Minamoto and the Taira; on a smaller scale, Nagato was where the duel between the sword masters Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojiro happened. Due to its long coast, fish is the main foodstuff, and the area is famous for fugu, the meat of the Japanese blowfish. Unfortunately for some unlucky diners, fugu is extremely poisonous if not prepared properly!</long_description>

<long_description>Omi is dominated by Lake Biwa, Japan’s largest lake. Good soil and plenty of water make this an extremely fertile province. It is also known for the Koga-ryu, a school of ninjutsu from the Koka area. With its closeness to Kyoto, the old Imperial capital, Omi was an important location. When the capital moved to Edo, it became host to a series of post stations along the Tokaido road between the two cities.</long_description>

<long_description>Together with Satsuma, Osumi forms the most southerly part of Japan, excluding the Ryukyu Islands. It has many active volcanoes, with Sakurajima being the most unstable. The volcanic soil and frequent ash deposits actually make the place rather fertile. The island of Tanegashima, where the Portugese captain Mendes Pinto was stranded in 1543, belongs to the Osumi Islands. For a long time all muskets were called “tanegashima”, as gunpowder in Japan was thought to originate from here.</long_description>

Its isolated location makes it easily defensible and a good strategic position.

<long_description>Situated on the north coast of Shikoku, Sanuki has always had good links to the main islands. Although it is not a wealthy province, its quarries can be a major economic asset. Kukai, the founder of the Shingon branch of Japanese Buddhism, was born and raised here, while the deity of scholarship, Sugawara no Michizane, wrote much of his poetry while governing Sanuki. The province also claims to be the first to adopt udon, the famous noodle dish. Today, Sanuki is the Kagawa prefecture, and is home to one of Japan’s most beautiful traditional gardens.</long_description>

<long_description>Satsuma is a wealthy province on the southern end of Kyushu. Home to the Shimazu clan, it has a long and impressive swordsmithing tradition. Its remote location and good trading links make it a good place for foreign trade. The Shimazu ruled the area for a long time, and can be considered one of the most successful clans. They conquered the Ryukyu kingdom, managed to gain various exceptions from Shogunate rule, and had major influence within the Meiji government.</long_description>

<long_description>Settsu is not a farming province, but its proximity to the capital and its Inland Sea port makes it very valuable. As a relatively urbanized province with a fairly substantial middle class it is also a place of administration and learning. It is also home to the oldest temple in Japan and to the rebellious and troublesome Ikko-Ikki. Today Osaka, the provincial capital, is the financial hub of Japan and has the headquarters of many well-known companies, such as Panasonic and Capcom. Osaka Castle is a prominent tourist destination, and the city’s inhabitants are well known for both their cuisine and distinctive dialect.</long_description>

Under the Ouchi family, the capital Yamaguchi has become known as the “Kyoto of the West” due to its great cultural achievements, making it the unofficial second city of Japan. It was here, among the educated population, that Francis Xavier, the famed Jesuit missionary, found patronage and support for his attempts to convert the Japanese to Catholicism.</long_description>

<long_description>Being mainly mountains, Suruga is not well suited to farming. The capital, Sumpu, is the main stronghold of the Imagawa clan and has a long tradition of political bickering. Tokugawa Ieyasu apparently retired to Suruga, although he quietly set up a second court to continue his rule out of the public gaze. The last Shogun, Yoshinobu, also came to Suruga to retire, but was refused permission to live at Sumpu Castle by the newly-restored Meiji regime. </long_description>

<long_description>Tajima is a small province situated on the San’in Coast. Though it doesn’t produce a large income, it has the advantage of its position, as it is a gateway between the coastal areas separated by the Chugoku Mountains. Nowadays, Tajima has gained global fame for being the birthplace of Kobe beef. Made from Wagyu cattle that are bred and reared following strict tradition, it is widely regarded as a delicacy and, possibly, the best beef in the world.</long_description>

Nowadays it is part of the Akita prefecture and still famous for the production of sake, along with the drinking of sake. Some claim it is home to the most beautiful women in all of Japan, although is that the sake speaking? It is also home to Ono no Komachi, one of Japan’s most famous female poets and, according to Catholic tradition, the Virgin Mary once appeared there as well.</long_description>

<long_description>Wakasa province lies on the western coast, between Wakasa Bay and Lake Biwa. While relatively small and underdeveloped, it is a crossroads of major routes, making it of some strategic value. The area is well known for its fishing, and provides much of Kyoto’s seafood. Its capital, Obama, gained some fame-by-association in 2008 due to it sharing the name with the new American president, Barack Obama. The ensuing craze resulted in Hula groups, Obama candy, and other such merchandise.</long_description>

<long_description>Located in the rich Japanese heartland and bordering Kyoto, Yamato is a valuable asset for its owners. Yamato gives its name to the earliest Japanese empire, which originated here, and Todai-ji, Japan’s largest temple, can be found here. The word “Yamato” is often used in conjunction with subjects and values that are seen as traditionally very Japanese: it has a deep resonance in the culture. This was why the largest warship (other than modern aircraft carriers) ever constructed was the Imperial Japanese Navy’s Yamato, a 73,000 ton super-battleship armed with 410mm guns. The ship saw only limited action in the Second World War, and was sunk by US aircraft in April 1945. The great vessel capsized and then exploded; the captain and commanding admiral went down with their ship.</long_description>

<long_description>Etchu, located in the west of Honshu, is a coastal province plagued by frequent flooding. This proved detrimental to rice cultivation and agriculture until irrigation networks were established during the Edo period. Because of its strategic position, Etchu was the site of many battles throughout history, including the Battle of Kurikara. This marked the turning point in the Gempei War, when the Minamoto victory cleared the way for their undisputed rise to power and the establishment of the first Shogunate.</long_description>

<long_description>Located in westernmost Tokaido, Iga province is home to the Iga Sokoku Ikki, a group of minor clans - including the Hattori - and the founders of the Iga school of ninjutsu. Their formidable ninjutsu skills, combined with their intimate knowledge of the mountainous terrain, allowed the Iga families to maintain their independence for many years. They were almost destroyed when Oda Nobunaga invaded Iga in 1581, although many escaped and survived to serve Tokugawa Ieyasu when he rose to power.</long_description>

<long_description>On the northwest coast of Chubu, Inaba’s numerous lakes and marshes make it ideal for the cultivation of rice. The provincial capital of Tottori derives its name from the term Tottoribe, meaning “one who catches birds”. This stems from the extensive hunting of water birds in the area, during a period of Japanese history when the Imperial Court ordered that fowl were to be handed over as tax.</long_description>

<long_description>Mino is situated in the heart of Honshu, a great and fertile plain surrounded by mountains. A strategically important location owing to its central position, it was often thought that holding the provincial capital of Gifu was the key to victory. Mino province was the site of the hugely important Battle of Sekigahara, which resulted in a Tokugawa victory over the Toyotomi. This battle secured Tokugawa Ieyasu's position, and made his rise to ultimate power almost inevitable.</long_description>

<long_description>Musashi is moderately fertile and situated in the eastern Kanto plains. Following the Sengoku Jidai, Tokugawa Ieyasu established his seat of power in the provincial capital, Edo, and the city lent its name to the period that marked the rule of the Tokugawa clan as heads of the Shogunate. The city, now called Tokyo, remains the capital of Japan.</long_description>

<long_description>Fertile and humid, Nagato is located on the western-most tip of Honshu, Japan’s main island. Many famous battles have taken place here, such as the sea battle of Dan-no-Ura between the Minamoto and the Taira; on a smaller scale, Nagato was where the duel between the sword masters Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojiro happened. Due to its long coast, fish is the main foodstuff, and the area is famous for fugu, the meat of the Japanese blowfish. Unfortunately for some unlucky diners, fugu is extremely poisonous if not prepared properly!</long_description>

<long_description>Omi is dominated by Lake Biwa, Japan’s largest lake. Good soil and plenty of water make this an extremely fertile province. It is also known for the Koga-ryu, a school of ninjutsu from the Koka area. With its closeness to Kyoto, the old Imperial capital, Omi was an important location. When the capital moved to Edo, it became host to a series of post stations along the Tokaido road between the two cities.</long_description>

<long_description>Together with Satsuma, Osumi forms the most southerly part of Japan, excluding the Ryukyu Islands. It has many active volcanoes, with Sakurajima being the most unstable. The volcanic soil and frequent ash deposits actually make the place rather fertile. The island of Tanegashima, where the Portugese captain Mendes Pinto was stranded in 1543, belongs to the Osumi Islands. For a long time all muskets were called “tanegashima”, as gunpowder in Japan was thought to originate from here.</long_description>

<long_description>Sado Island lies off the north-western coast of Japan. While not very productive in terms of farming, it boasts some of Japan’s richest deposits of gold and silver. Its isolated location makes it easily defensible and a good strategic position. Due to its remoteness from Kyoto and Edo, it was a frequent place of exile for politically inconvenient public figures, among them the Emperor Juntoku and the founder of Nichiren Buddhism, Daishonin.</long_description>

<long_description>Situated on the north coast of Shikoku, Sanuki has always had good links to the main islands. Although it is not a wealthy province, its quarries can be a major economic asset. Kukai, the founder of the Shingon branch of Japanese Buddhism, was born and raised here, while the deity of scholarship, Sugawara no Michizane, wrote much of his poetry while governing Sanuki. The province also claims to be the first to adopt udon, the famous noodle dish. Today, Sanuki is the Kagawa prefecture, and is home to one of Japan’s most beautiful traditional gardens.</long_description>

Its remote location and good trading links make it a good place for foreign trade. The Shimazu ruled the area for a long time, and can be considered one of the most successful clans. They conquered the Ryukyu kingdom, managed to gain various exceptions from Shogunate rule, and had major influence within the Meiji government.</long_description>

<long_description>Settsu is not a farming province, but its proximity to the capital and its Inland Sea port makes it very valuable. As a relatively urbanized province with a fairly substantial middle class it is also a place of administration and learning. It is also home to the oldest temple in Japan and to the rebellious and troublesome Ikko-Ikki. Today Osaka, the provincial capital, is the financial hub of Japan and has the headquarters of many well-known companies, such as Panasonic and Capcom. Osaka Castle is a prominent tourist destination, and the city’s inhabitants are well known for both their cuisine and distinctive dialect.</long_description>

<long_description>Lying at the westerly tip of Honshu, Suo has good transport and horse trading resources. Under the Ouchi family, the capital Yamaguchi has become known as the “Kyoto of the West” due to its great cultural achievements, making it the unofficial second city of Japan. It was here, among the educated population, that Francis Xavier, the famed Jesuit missionary, found patronage and support for his attempts to convert the Japanese to Catholicism.</long_description>

<long_description>Being mainly mountains, Suruga is not well suited to farming. The capital, Sumpu, is the main stronghold of the Imagawa clan and has a long tradition of political bickering. Tokugawa Ieyasu apparently retired to Suruga, although he quietly set up a second court to continue his rule out of the public gaze. The last Shogun, Yoshinobu, also came to Suruga to retire, but was refused permission to live at Sumpu Castle by the newly-restored Meiji regime. </long_description>

<long_description>Tajima is a small province situated on the San’in Coast. Though it doesn’t produce a large income, it has the advantage of its position, as it is a gateway between the coastal areas separated by the Chugoku Mountains. Nowadays, Tajima has gained global fame for being the birthplace of Kobe beef. Made from Wagyu cattle that are bred and reared following strict tradition, it is widely regarded as a delicacy and, possibly, the best beef in the world.</long_description>

<long_description>Tamba is one of the few landlocked provinces in Japan, and is not a wealthy area. However, it is very close to the capital city of Kyoto, which gives it some positional, strategic importance. Akechi Mitsuhide staged his coup against Oda Nobunaga here, leading to the Honno-ji incident and eventually Nobunaga forced seppuku. </long_description>

<long_description>While not wealthy, Tango is gifted with one of the three “Views of Japan”. The Amanohashidate, or Bridge to Heaven, is a thin strip of land connecting both sides of Myazu Bay, and is the subject of countless paintings. Today the area is home to a major base for the Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force, or what would be the Navy if the modern constitution allowed such a thing.</long_description>

<long_description>Tosa covers the entire southern coast of Shikoku and is a moderately wealthy province that offers a safe haven from the aggression of most other clans. It has plentiful woods, making it a good place for shipbuilding. Today, Tosa has the only castle in Japan that retains both its original keep and palace. Kochi was constructed by Yamauchi Kazutoyo, the provincial ruler, after the Tokugawa victory at the Battle of Sekigahara. </long_description>

<long_description>Tsukushi is in the heart of Kyushu, and is an extremely rich province. The city of Dazaifu is one of the major military and administrative centres of feudal Japan. Historically, Tsukushi was where foreign embassies, including that of the Chinese, could be found. Sugawara no Michizane, a scholar who was deified as the Kami of learning, spent his final years here in exile. Today, the capital is Fukuoka, the most populous city on Kyushu. It is also one of Japan’s most dynamic cities.</long_description>

<long_description>Ugo is a fertile province, and its remote location in the far northwest helps keep it a very rural place. It produces mainly sake, vegetables and building stone. Nowadays it is part of the Akita prefecture and still famous for the production of sake, along with the drinking of sake. Some claim it is home to the most beautiful women in all of Japan, although is that the sake speaking? It is also home to Ono no Komachi, one of Japan’s most famous female poets and, according to Catholic tradition, the Virgin Mary once appeared there as well.</long_description>

<long_description>Uzen is a fertile, agricultural province, and is known for its cherries and the thistly safflower, used for dyeing. Its mountain ranges make this an easily defensible region. Three of Japan’s most holy mountains stand in the province, and the area is an important site for practitioners of Shugendo, an ascetic Shintoist belief.</long_description>

<long_description>Wakasa province lies on the western coast, between Wakasa Bay and Lake Biwa. While relatively small and underdeveloped, it is a crossroads of major routes, making it of some strategic value. The area is well known for its fishing, and provides much of Kyoto’s seafood. Its capital, Obama, gained some fame-by-association in 2008 due to it sharing the name with the new American president, Barack Obama. The ensuing craze resulted in Hula groups, Obama candy, and other such merchandise.</long_description>

<long_description>Kyoto is capital of the small province of Yamashiro: it is the spiritual, intellectual and administrative centre of Japan. Both the Ashikaga Shogun and the Emperor reside here, and holding Yamashiro should be the main objective for any daimyo aspiring to subdue and rule Japan. Even today, Kyoto has retained its status as the heart of traditional Japanese culture. With its numerous shrines, temples and cultural events it is the second most popular tourist destination in Japan, receiving over thirty million visitors each year.</long_description>

<long_description>Located in the rich Japanese heartland and bordering Kyoto, Yamato is a valuable asset for its owners. Yamato gives its name to the earliest Japanese empire, which originated here, and Todai-ji, Japan’s largest temple, can be found here. The word “Yamato” is often used in conjunction with subjects and values that are seen as traditionally very Japanese: it has a deep resonance in the culture. This was why the largest warship (other than modern aircraft carriers) ever constructed was the Imperial Japanese Navy’s Yamato, a 73,000 ton super-battleship armed with 410mm guns. The ship saw only limited action in the Second World War, and was sunk by US aircraft in April 1945. The great vessel capsized and then exploded; the captain and commanding admiral went down with their ship.</long_description>
