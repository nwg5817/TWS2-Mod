<class>textblock</class>
<content>The domain of Aizu provided constant resistance to the Imperialists during the Boshin war, so following the fall of Edo represented the keystone of the northern resistance. The Imperial forces resolved to break the back of this opposition, marching to war with Aizu in the Autumn of 1868. Through the Bonari Pass and into Aizu itself the invaders met with stout resistance but eventually forced the capitulation of Matsudaira Katamori, the daimyo of Aizu, in November of that year. The campaign is famous for the tenacious defence mounted by the citizens of Aizu, and in particular the White Tigers, the youngest of the enlisted Aizu soldiers. Mistakenly believing their home town lost, all but one committed seppuku on a hillside overlooking the castle. Following the battle, the traditional values espoused by their story resonated strongly through a Japan struggling to come to terms with its rapid modernisation.</content>

<class>textblock</class>
<content>In 1570, during Oda Nobunaga’s campaign to become Shogun, he chose to besiege Odani Castle, home of his new enemy Asai Nagamasa. Asai had recently broken his alliance with Oda, presenting a danger to the flanks of the Oda forces stationed in the region. When Oda and his ally Tokugawa Ieyasu moved against the castle Asai and his allies sallied out to meet the attackers. What followed was a bloody struggle in the flowing waters of the River Anegawa. Although the Asai fought well and seemed on the verge of defeating Oda, the budding warlord managed to hold them in place (by excellent tactical use of his 500 matchlock ashigaru) until Tokugawa, having dispensed with Asai’s allies, could wheel around and attack the Asai right flank. At this point the Oda general Inaba Ittetsu, who had been hitherto held in reserve, brought his force to bear on the Asai left flank. Eventually realising that the day had gone against him, Asai retreated and withdrew back inside the castle, leaving Oda and his allies depleted and weary of battle. Oda didn’t attack Odani Castle again for three years, during which time the Asai managed to inflict a retaliatory defeat upon him which resulted in the death of Oda Nobuharu, Nobunaga’s younger brother.</content>

<content>In October 1868, towards the end of the Boshin War, the remaining forces of the Shogunate attempted to consolidate under the banner of the Ezo Republic. Around 3000 rebels retreated to the northern island of Hokkaido and occupied a massive star-fort known as Goryokaku. Built in the European style to counter potential threats from foreign aggressors, Goryokaku was thought to be virtually impregnable to assault. Even so, the rebels, and their French military advisors, lost no time in fortifying the surrounding countryside against the inevitable Imperial attack. Following the naval Battle of Miyako, Imperial forces landed on 9th April 1869. What followed was a period of intense fighting, as the Emperor’s men systematically defeated the entrenched rebel troops before besieging and capturing Goryokaku itself. Following the loss of around half its troop strength and the unexpected and hurried departure of its French military advisors, the Ezo Republic surrendered on 17th May 1869.</content>

<content>By the late 16th century, the Hojo [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_clan&quot;]]clan[[/url]] had expanded into the Kanto region; territory previously ruled by their rivals the Uesugi. In 1545, seeking to reclaim the lost land, the two remaining branches of the Uesugi clan - the Yamanouchi and the Ogigayatsu – joined forces alongside Ashikaga Haruuji, a treacherous former Hojo ally. The Uesugi besieged Kawagoe castle with 85,000 men, capture of which would give them control of the valuable Hojo northern defences. Leading the garrison of 3,000 was Hojo Tsunanari, who managed to get word of the siege to his brother, Hojo Ujiyasu, in command of another 8,000 troops. Still massively outnumbered, the Hojo brothers’ only chance was a surprise night attack on the overconfident Uesugi. This daring assault resulted in disarray and utter defeat for the Uesugi and their allies. Ogigayatsu Tomosada was killed during the battle, bringing his line to an end. The Uesugi were also brought dangerously close to extinction.  </content>

<content>The rivalry began when Takeda Shingen’s conquests resulted in the expulsion of Uesugi allies Murakami Yoshiharu and Ogasawara Nagatoki from their fiefs and the Takeda began to threaten Uesugi Kenshin’s borders. Following a number of indecisive skirmishes, Kenshin decided to launch a massive assault to finally rid himself of Shingen. Kenshin’s army of 18,000 was positioned on the mountain of Saijoyama, looking down upon Shingen’s castle, and were unaware that they had caught him by surprise with only a small garrison present. Shingen, absent at the time, received word of Kenshin’s move and travelled to fortify the castle with 20,000 warriors, keeping the river between his force and Kenshin’s as protection. Once back inside the walls, Shingen attempted to trap Kenshin in a pincer movement, but the move was anticipated and Kenshin’s army broke through the Takeda defensive lines. Legend has it that Kenshin and Shingen personally met in battle and, caught off-guard in his command tent, Shingen fought defensively until a retainer could spear Kenshin’s horse and drive him away. Neither side was able to claim outright victory as, despite the eventual rout of the Uesugi army following a flanking action to their rear, the Takeda also lost many important generals in the battle. The 4th Battle of Kawanakajima resulted in the greatest number of casualties of any battle during the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_sengoku_jidai&quot;]]Sengoku Jidai[[/url]].</content>

<content>The Ikko-Ikki proved to be a great thorn in the side of Oda Nobunaga. They were fanatically dedicated, unafraid to die for their beliefs and had many powerful allies – who also happened to be enemies and rivals of Oda. Their main fortress was the Ishiyama Hongan-Ji, at the mouth of the Yodo River, and they were supported by the Mori, a [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_clan&quot;]]clan[[/url]] with formidable naval power. Oda Nobunaga had begun besieging the Hongan-Ji in 1576, but was met with great opposition. Seeking to weaken them, he set about isolating the monks from outside aid by breaking the Mori naval supply lines. Despite using Kuki Yoshitaka as his naval commander, who had served him so well at Nagashima, Oda’s fleet was outclassed by the superior Mori armada. For his second attempt, he discarded traditional fleet composition and instead replaced it with six giant, specially commissioned, iron-plated warships. These were called “o-ataka bunes&quot; and were larger than the ataka bunes, which in themselves were massive vessels. However, the battle revealed a flaw in the ships: when one was boarded, the crew rushed to meet the threat and the sudden shift in weight capsized it! However, the o adake bunes still proved their worth, beating the Mori and cutting off the Ikko-Ikki’s supplies. With no aid or allies to help them, the Ikko-Ikki soon used up all their resources and were forced to capitulate in 1580, granting Oda Nobunaga his long sought victory.</content>

<content>On 6th May 1869, the Imperial Navy reached the northern island of Hokkaido and the rebel forces of the so-called “Ezo Republic”. However, the former Shogunate forces were ready for them, and launched several ships to head off the Imperial ships. Unfortunately, two of the Ezo ships had engine trouble. The Banryu got left behind and returned to port while the Takao couldn’t join the battle by the time Kaiten, the Ezo flagship, attacked and boarded its opposite number, the iron-clad Kotetsu. To make matters worse, the height difference between the Kaiten and the Kotetsu meant that the rebel samurai were unable to board en masse. Once the Kotetsu’s Gatling gun opened up the boarders were easily mown down. Somehow, the Kaiten managed to disengage and escape Miyako Bay, but the Takao, still crippled by engine failure, was beached and scuttled close by. The daring attempt to capture the Imperial flagship ended in failure, allowing the Imperial Army to land and proceed to Hakodate for the final battle of the war.</content>

<content>Oda Nobunaga considered the rebellious Ikko-Ikki a very real threat, and one he would have to overcome if he was to rule Japan. The Ikko-Ikki was a religious fundamentalist sect made up of priests, peasants and farmers who fought for independent rule and rallied against the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_samurai&quot;]]samurai[[/url]] warlords who were ravaging their land. In 1571, Nobunaga launched a campaign against them by attacking their Nagashima complex. However, his men were hindered by the poor, muddy terrain which left them vulnerable, forcing a retreat. A second attempt was made in 1573, but this time a heavy downpour drenched the Oda army’s matchlocks, and a swift counter-attack by the Ikko-Ikki once again forced him to withdraw. In 1574 Oda took a different approach, this time bolstering his land forces with a naval fleet commanded by Kuki Yoshitaka. Kuki’s ships bombarded the Ikko-Ikki defences with fire arrows, whilst also cutting them off from any supplies or reinforcements.  Meanwhile, Oda’s land forces captured their forts until he had gained control of the west side of the island. Having established this foothold, the Ikko-Ikki back were forced back until they were cornered in a small area of the island. Cut off from supplies and any chance of relief, the Ikko-Ikki starved whilst a tall palisade was built around them. Oda set fire to the palisade, burning alive everyone inside.</content>

<content>In 1575, a combined Oda and Tokugawa force of 38,000 was sent to alleviate Nagashino Castle, then besieged by Takeda Katsuyori. Though the Takeda army of 15,000 was vastly outnumbered, his cavalry was incredibly powerful and were dreaded by the allies, who had previously suffered defeat at their hands on the field at Mikatagahara. Oda Nobunaga himself possessed 3,000 matchlock troops, believing that a solid wall of arquebusiers could stop the Takeda cavalry charge in its tracks. The allied forces were positioned in front of the Rengogawa River and Oda Nobunaga built a wooden stockade to protect his men from the brunt of the enemy charge. Takeda Katsuyori sent his cavalry to attack, believing that the heavy rain would render most of the guns useless and that those that did work could not be reloaded quickly enough for a second barrage. However, Nobunaga’s matchlocks remained dry and unleashed their fire upon the Takeda cavalry as they slowed down to negotiate the steep banks of the river, resulting in the routing of the Takeda army and the lifting of the siege at Nagashino.</content>

<content>In 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto, a great warlord, marched an army of approximately 25,000 towards Kyoto. He had spread word that his army had far greater numbers in order to strike fear into the hearts of potential challengers, and his army had already taken the Oda [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_clan&quot;]]clan's[[/url]] border fortresses of Washizu and Marune. Oda Nobunaga was the ruler of the Oda province, but his rise to power had been controversial and he was still unproven. He sent out scouts, who reported back that the army was celebrating their recent victories with dance and drink at a forest gorge called Dengaku-hazama. Although his army was vastly outnumbered, Oda rightly suspected that the reports of Imagawa’s numbers had been greatly exaggerated and realised that, while they were camped at Dengaku-hazama, there was a chance they could be taken by surprise. Ignoring the pleas of his advisors to surrender, he set up a small army in front of the gorge that carried many banners to give the appearance that his main force had arrived. Then, Oda’s main force of 3000 sneaked through the forest to the rear of Imagawa’s camp. At this point a large storm erupted, enabling them to get close without detection. Once it cleared, Oda’s army rushed into the camp. The Imagawa army was indeed still celebrating, was caught by surprise and were so shocked that they fled in all directions - their discipline and training entirely forgotten. This left Imagawa Yoshimoto unprotected in his tent and still unaware that anything was wrong. He had been inspecting the heads he had collected as trophies from the last battle and, upon hearing the commotion, simply thought the drunken revelry had gotten out of control. As he left the tent, he mistook one of Nobunaga’s men as his own and ordered him back to his post. He realised his error in time to dodge the samurai’s spear, but was quickly beheaded by another. By the time the battle was over, only two of the Imagawa officers remained and, knowing they were beaten, they joined Oda Nobunaga’s force along with their surviving troops. One of these men was Tokugawa Ieyasu, who remained a lifelong ally of Oda Nobunaga as he began his own brilliant career trajectory.</content>

To make matters worse, Tokugawa Yoshinobu promised to command his forces during the next phase, but then he fled Osaka Castle upon seeing the Imperial banner, shaken by the Emperor’s apparent endorsement of his enemies. Nevertheless, as the Imperial army approached Osaka, intending to burn the symbol of an outmoded Shogunate to the ground, Yoshinobu’s remaining troops deployed to defend their castle to the last man…</content>

<content>Before his death, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, unifier of Japan, established the Council of Five Elders to rule as regents until his heir Hideyori, came of age. However, one of the elders, Tokugawa Ieyasu, was unable to accept Toyotomi Hideyori as [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_shogun&quot;]]Shogun[[/url]], as the Toyotomi were originally of peasant stock. Wanting power for himself, Tokugawa pitted himself against the loyalist council members, including Ishida Mitsunari. Soon there were two camps; Ieyasu’s eastern side and Mitsunari’s western side. Both sides tried to enlist the aid of Kobayakawa Hideaki and other more moderate daimyos. At the Battle of Sekigahara, Ieyasu and Mitsunari’s armies clashed, each awaiting Hideaki to join their side in the battle. As his position overlooked them, Hideaki could either surround Ieyasu or bolster his army. Realising that his involvement was crucial to the outcome, Hideaki ignored Ishida Mitsunari's signal to join him, but did not rush to help the Tokugawa either. To coax him into action, Tokugawa Ieyasu ordered his troops to fire upon Hideaki’s, a gamble which paid off when he promptly chose to join Ieyasu! The subsequent assault on eastern positions caused four generals to immediately switch sides, severely weakening the eastern forces, which soon fell apart. In the aftermath of the battle several eastern generals committed suicide, their leader Ishida Mitsunari was executed and many others lost control of their fiefdoms in favour of those who supported the Tokugawa. Ieyasu himself went on to become Shogun, bringing the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_sengoku_jidai&quot;]]Sengoku Jidai[[/url]] to a close. The Tokugawa clan ruled Japan until the Meiji Restoration in 1867.</content>

<content>Following the anti-Shogunate political intrigues set in motion by the Satsuma and Choshu domains, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, the Shogun, sent his army to report his suspicions to the Emperor. At least, that was the pretext. There had recently been much provocation of Shogunate forces in the capital city, Kyoto, and it is thought that Tokugawa intended to remove the radical elements from the Imperial Court. As his army approached Kyoto they found a Satsuma force blocking the route. Armed with new Western artillery, the Satsuma and their allies, the Choshu, had no intention of allowing the Shogun’s army into Kyoto. They raised the banner of the Emperor against the army of the Shogun. War became inevitable. After two bloody days of fighting the Shogun’s army were in retreat to his base at the mighty Osaka Castle.</content>

<content>Following his surrender of the capital and his resignation, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, the former Shogun, retired to his family’s Kan’ei-ji Temple at Ueno. However, the Shogitai, the forces loyal to his office, refused to give up the fight so easily. They continued to harass the Imperial army as it occupied Edo. Eventually, and despite a disparity of numbers, the Imperial forces, chiefly the Satsuma, attacked Kan’ei-ji. Despite heavy casualties, the Satsuma managed to pin down the entrenched Shogitai until the Choshu, the Satsuma’s allies, charged the defenders’ rear. Although outnumbered, the Imperial army’s use of the most modern available guns tipped the balance in their favour. Most of the Shogitai leaders escaped by sea, including the abbot of the temple, Prince Yoshihisa, who was actually a member of the Imperial family and a candidate for the Imperial throne if the Shogunate won.</content>

When you select a castle or a building elsewhere in a [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_province&quot;]]province[[/url]] (such as a port or farm), the construction tab will appear. Left-click on a building to add it to the construction queue, and again to remove it. The cost of construction is displayed in the bottom left and the time required is shown in the bottom right of the picture. Buildings facilitate unit production, can increase income and improve governmental control within a province. The number of slots available for building inside a castle town or settlement depends on the level of the castle - so the larger the castle, the greater the number of possible surrounding buildings. Any chain of buildings can be constructed in any of these slots, although some buildings require the presence of certain resources or the mastery of certain arts before they can be constructed.

If you are the first to construct one your clan will be awarded a permanent [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/022_enc_manual_clan_traits.html&quot;]]clan trait[[/url]] and its associated effects, as well as the opportunity to recruit heroes. Guard your legendary buildings well, they will quickly become a target for your enemies. Legendary buildings produce heroes. Heroes fight in exactly the same way as other units, but are led by an exceptional exponent of his chosen weapon. There is a hero-type for each of the different weapon disciplines; which one can be recruited depends on the type of legendary building you have constructed. Each hero is joined on the field by an entourage of loyal pupils, much like a general and his bodyguard. He can also [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/060m_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_inspire_land.html&quot;]]inspire[[/url]] units close to him by his presence, in the same way as a general.</content>

<content>The Boshin War, featured in Fall of the Samurai, was a time for clans to decide where their loyalties lay – to the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_shogunate&quot;]]Shogunate[[/url]] or to the Emperor: to the status quo or to the future. As such, clans in the game can either be pro-Shogunate or pro-Imperial. Every clan begins the campaign already aligned, and you must spread your influence to get their support. [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_ shinsengumi &quot;]]Shinsengumi[[/url]] or [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_ishin_shishi&quot;]]ishin shishi[[/url]] can spread a clan’s influence simply by their presence in a province. Leaving them in place will eventually lead to a declaration of allegiance. Once a clan declares their allegiance they must fight for the cause they have chosen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_camp_advanced_family.html#s2_bosh_tut_campaign_advanced_13&quot;]]here[[/url]] to view a video tutorial about this subject.</content>

Simply select your metsuke, right-click on the target army or garrison and select bribery from the options presented to you. A panel will appear stating the chances of success. If you decide to go ahead with the mission your metsuke will pursue the target and attempt to bribe them. A general who has been successfully bribed will form a new army with those troops who have decided to follow him (which may not be all of them) and begin moving towards your territory. He will also lose [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/025_enc_manual_clan_loyalty.html&quot;]]loyalty[[/url]], as befits one who will betray his own so easily. If one of your generals is bribed, his family will be expelled from your clan and will disappear from the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/016_enc_manual_hud_management.html#enc_text_manual_hud_management_family&quot;]]family tree[[/url]]. Bribery of a garrison has to be completely successful for its province to change allegiance, otherwise the bribed units will leave the castle town and begin moving towards your territory in the same way as units from an army bribed in the field. Where a castle town does not have a garrison, a successful bribe will cause the entire province to change allegiance to your clan. To bribe, simply select your metsuke, right-click on your chosen target and select bribe from the options presented to you.</content>

<content>Shogun 2 deals with the important religions in Japan during the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_sengoku_jidai&quot;]]Sengoku Jidai[[/url]]: [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_shinto&quot;]]Shinto[[/url]]-Buddhism, Christianity and radical Jodo Shinshu Buddhism - as practiced by the Ikko Ikki extremists. Japan has long felt the influence of Buddhism from the mainland; but now, with the arrival of European traders, the &quot;new&quot; religion of Christianity is slowly gaining a foothold, clan by clan, as ships arrive bringing goods from the west. Whereas [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_buddhism&quot;]]Buddhist[[/url]] clans use [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/045_enc_manual_agents_religious.html#enc_text_manual_agents_religious_monks&quot;]]monks[[/url]] to propagate enlightened thought, those clans that have converted to Christianity field [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/045_enc_manual_agents_religious.html#enc_text_manual_agents_religious_missionaries&quot;]]missionaries[[/url]] instead to spread the word of God throughout the country. Both agents are able to convert both populations and individual characters to their religions. An agent’s rank – represented by the stars at the top of his [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/045b_enc_manual_ui_character.html&quot;]]character details panel[[/url]] - in combination with other bonuses inferred by skills, retainers or traits, enhance his ability to carry out the various [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/045a_enc_manual_agent_actions_religious.html&quot;]]actions[[/url]] he is capable of and withstand the hostile actions of enemy agents. When there are monks or missionaries embedded inside castle towns the effects provided by their presence gradually diminish - so a second agent provides a further 50% of the effects of the first, and a third provides a further 25%. The maximum number of agents that can be embedded is three.</content>

<content>Subterfuge agents are single characters who are used to commit acts of espionage on the campaign map. They are able to act upon enemy armies or buildings but cannot go inside them, so always remain visible and easy to locate. It is possible for your own agents to enter your armies and castle towns or settlements (in Fall of the Samurai) up to a maximum of three agents per army or castle town. When there are agents embedded inside castle towns or settlements the effects provided by their presence gradually diminish - so a second agent provides a further 50% of the effects of the first, and a third provides a further 25%. Before carrying out an ordered action a prompt will appear, requiring confirmation. Every agent action has a monetary cost associated with it, which is stated on the prompt. An agent’s rank – represented by the stars at the top of his [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/045b_enc_manual_ui_character.html&quot;]]character details panel[[/url]] - in combination with other bonuses inferred by skills, retainers or traits, enhance his ability to carry out the various [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/044a_enc_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge.html&quot;]]actions[[/url]] he is capable of and withstand the hostile actions of enemy agents.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_camp_advanced_agents.html#s2_bosh_tut_campaign_advanced_15&quot;]]here[[/url]] to view a video tutorial about this subject.</content>

Generally apolitical, veterans are only interested in the money that the escalating conflict can bring them, and will work for either side if the price is right, even carrying out [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/044a_enc_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_sabotage&quot;]]sabotage[[/url]] missions if paid to do so. Foreign veterans can be recruited via the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/buildings/bos_port_4_british_trading_district.html&quot;]]foreign quarters[[/url]] of the port building chain. If placed in a friendly town foreign veterans reduce recruitment costs simply by their presence. In addition, they are also able to [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/044a_enc_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_harass&quot;]]harass[[/url]] enemy armies, reducing their [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/052_enc_manual_battle_conflict_morale.html&quot;]]morale[[/url]] and causing [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/030_enc_manual_army_attrition.html&quot;]]attrition[[/url]], and can challenge other agents to [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/044a_enc_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_single_combat&quot;]]single combat[[/url]], which will result in the death or dishonour of the losing party.

Geisha can use their enchantment skills to convince her target to join your cause. They are able to entertain the nobles of friendly towns in order to boost their growth and inspire friendly generals in the field, which increases their loyalty and counteracts the efforts of enemy geisha to enchant them to change sides. If placed in a friendly town geisha improve [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/019a_enc_manual_province_wealth.html&quot;]]town growth[[/url]] simply by their presence. They can be recruited via the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/buildings/bos_criminal_1_inn.html&quot;]]business chain[[/url]] of buildings. Geisha are vulnerable to shinobi and exceptionally dangerous to foreign veterans. Shingsengumi and ishin shishi are too loyal to their causes, and as such are immune to the geisha’s charms.</content>

<content>An army can attack another army, a castle town (or settlement in Fall of the Samurai), or any building on the map. Buildings will be raided and damaged, but cannot be occupied or garrisoned. An attack on a castle town will result in a [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/028_enc_manual_army_attack.html#enc_text_manual_army_attack_siege&quot;]]siege[[/url]] taking place. If the target is further away than your army's movement extent will allow, it will take more than one turn to reach it and launch an attack. Once an army has reached its target the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/032_enc_manual_ui_battle.html&quot;]]battle panel[[/url]] will be displayed, prompting you to fight on the battlefield, [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/032_enc_manual_ui_battle.html# enc_text_manual_ui_battle_auto&quot;]]resolve the battle automatically[[/url]], withdraw or lay siege (when appropriate).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_camp_essentials_conflict.html#s2_bosh_tut_camp_essentials_08&quot;]]here[[/url]] to view a video tutorial about this subject.</content>

<content>An army positioned in a forest can sometimes launch an ambush against a passing enemy. If you choose to attack, your forces can be split between each side of the road and the enemy force will be deployed in marching, rather than battle, order. The enemy army will not have the opportunity to move their units in any way until the battle starts, so deploy carefully to cause maximum confusion and disorder. If you decide not to launch an ambush, the army will pass without being alerted to your presence. NB - If you are playing battles on hard or very hard difficulty and are ambushed it will not be possible to issue orders when the battle is paused.</content>

<class>textblock</class>
<content>In order to gain control of a garrisoned and fortified castle town (or settlement in Fall of the Samurai) it is often necessary to lay siege. During a siege your troops surround the castle and can either attempt to starve the defenders into capitulation or launch a direct assault. The besieged force may also choose to sally out to meet you on the battlefield, but be aware that defeating them will not automatically result in the surrender of the castle to you. Victory in a siege turns ownership of the province over to your clan. You then have the option to occupy peacefully or loot the castle. Looting provides a cash lump sum but carries a greater penalty to [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/020_enc_manual_public_order.html&quot;]]public order[[/url]] (and indeed your daimyo's honour) than occupation alone. There will also be public order issues if the new owners of a [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_province&quot;]]province[[/url]] are of a different religion to that of the populace.

<class>textblock</class>
<content>An army that has suffered casualties or [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/030_enc_manual_army_attrition.html&quot;]]attrition[[/url]] requires fresh recruits to replenish troop numbers. If an army contains a general and is on friendly territory, unit replenishment will occur automatically. Without a general, an army can only replenish within a castle town or settlement (in Fall of the Samurai) belonging to its own clan. The closer an army is to a province with fresh recruits in it, the faster the rate of replenishment will be. If no replenishment occurs it may be because the army is in an enemy province or an area of attrition. The rate of replenishment can be improved by [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/016_enc_manual_hud_management.html#enc_text_manual_hud_management_commissions&quot;]]making[[/url]] one of your generals “Commissioner for Supply”, as can the  acquisition of certain [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/043_enc_manual_traits.html#enc_text_manual_retainers&quot;]]retainers[[/url]].</content>

<block_key>enc_text_manual_army_generals</block_key>
<class>textblock</class>
<content>Generals are used to command armies and fleets in battle. Their command rating influences the effectiveness with which their army or fleet fights. When a force does not have a general one of the other units is assigned as the command unit. The command unit does not become a general’s bodyguard, its unit type stays the same. In these cases the army fights with a severe disadvantage, as there is no-one to [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/049_enc_manual_battle_conflict_controls.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_modes_rallying&quot;]]rally[[/url]] or [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/060m_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_inspire_land.html&quot;]]inspire[[/url]] the troops, although the command unit does provide a small morale bonus. A successful battle fought without a general may result in the commander being offered for promotion to general. A general’s loyalty to his [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_daimyo&quot;]]daimyo[[/url]], if low, can lead him to defect to an enemy [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_clan&quot;]]clan[[/url]]. The daimyo is also a general, although in his case personal [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/026_enc_manual_clan_honour.html&quot;]]honour[[/url]] replaces [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/025_enc_manual_clan_loyalty.html&quot;]]loyalty[[/url]]. The daimyo’s sons all become generals when they come of age. Generals can be assigned useful [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/042_enc_manual_skills.html&quot;]]skills[[/url]] and [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/043_enc_manual_traits.html#enc_text_manual_retainers&quot;]]retainers[[/url]] as they gain [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/031_enc_manual_army_experience.html&quot;]]experience[[/url]] in battle and increase in rank. They can also be assigned [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/016_enc_manual_hud_management.html#enc_text_manual_hud_management_commissioners&quot;]]commissions[[/url]] to convey additional bonuses.</content>

Inspire can only be used a few times before becoming unavailable for a fixed period, thereby limiting its exploitability. As a general gains experience in the field, the ability to inspire improves and the cooling down time required between activations is reduced.</content>

<content>Key buildings give you a tactical advantage over your enemy on the battlefield when in [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/061_enc_manual_multiplayer.html&quot;]]multiplayer[[/url]] mode. Once captured, an army can use a key building to replenish ammunition, improve a units [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/052_enc_manual_battle_conflict_morale.html&quot;]]morale[[/url]] or [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/popup_armor_sets.html&quot;]]armour[[/url]]. As such, a key building can be the focus of combat as both sides vie for control. Each one has an icon floating above it that changes colour according to its state: yellow when your army has captured it, blue when an ally has captured it, grey if no one has captured it, and red if the enemy is in control.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the setup of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/solo_setup.html&quot;]]match-made[[/url]] and [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/custom_battle_script.html&quot;]]battle list[[/url]] battles when playing Fall of the Samurai, key buildings are randomly selected from a host of different options. This means there will be variations of key building type on your favourite maps, offering further variety of gameplay.</content>

<content>As a battle progresses, the units involved gradually become exhausted due to the high level of physical effort required to run and fight for such a protracted length of time. Once a unit becomes exhausted, even moving slowly becomes a great effort, leaving them particularly vulnerable to cavalry charges.

<block_key>enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_morale</block_key>
<class>textblock</class>
<content>Morale is a measure of a unit's confidence and spirit during a battle. During a lengthy, protracted melee, the morale of the men is severely tested, and they will break and rout if it gets too low. This is indicated by the coloured bar at the top of each unit’s banner; when it is green morale is healthy, when it turns yellow a morale penalty is in place, when it turns red the unit is wavering and about to break and rout. The presence of the general alone can improve morale and highly-trained, elite units have much higher morale from the outset. Heroes also improve morale of those around them by their presence. Generals can also rally their men more effectively by use of their special [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/060s_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_rally.html&quot;]]regroup position[[/url]], [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/060m_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_inspire_land.html&quot;]]inspire[[/url]] and [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/060n_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_inspire_sea.html&quot;]]encourage[[/url]] abilities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_land_units_abilities.html#s2_bosh_tut_battle_land_12&quot;]]here[[/url]] to view a video tutorial about this subject.</content>

<content>Naval battles work in exactly the same way as land battles: the battlefield is a seascape, individual ships replace units, and combat is controlled using essentially the same user interface as when fighting on land. During the period of history covered by Total War: Shogun 2 and the Rise of the Samurai campaign, fighting at sea consisted of firing arrows and then getting in close to [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/059_enc_manual_battle_naval_boarding.html&quot;]]board[[/url]] and melee. During the Boshin War, featured in the Fall of the Samurai campaign, [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/boshin_art_armstrong_guns.html&quot;]]artillery[[/url]] took centre stage, [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/bosh_enc_ammo_types.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_torpedoes&quot;]]torpedoes[[/url]] had been developed and [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/bosh_enc_abilities_ramming.html&quot;]]ramming[[/url]] (with the advent of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/boshin_ironclad_hms_warrior.html&quot;]]ironclad[[/url]] hulls) was a viable battle tactic.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_naval_introduction.html#s2_bosh_tut_battle_naval_01&quot;]]here[[/url]] to view a video tutorial about this subject.</content>

<content>When a ship fires all the cannons mounted on one side at another vessel this is known as a ‘broadside’. In order to do this it is necessary to carefully position your ship to ensure that the enemy takes the full brunt of your firepower. Clicking on the relevant broadside button (port or starboard) on the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/047_enc_manual_battle_conflict.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_review&quot;]]battle review panel[[/url]] once fixes the guns on their target and focuses their arc of fire. The second click simultaneously fires them. Between broadsides it is of course necessary to reload the cannons, represented by a cooling down period. This also limits exploitability.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_naval_broadsides.html#s2_bosh_tut_battle_naval_11&quot;]]here[[/url]] to view a video tutorial about this subject.</content>

<content>In Fall of the Samurai, if a port is attacked whilst ships are docked there, a siege battle must be fought for control of it. To achieve victory when attacking you must completely destroy the defending fleet or pound the port until it is reduced to rubble. If there are coastal defences in place the defending force will be bolstered by fire from gun batteries, which will act as fixed artillery whilst the battle is occurring. They will automatically select targets when set to fire-at-will, but you can also select and target the guns yourself if you wish.</content>

<content>There are five types of shot that can be used by [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/boshin_frigate_kaiyo_maru.html&quot;]]ships[[/url]], [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/bosh_enc_coastal_defences.html&quot;]]coastal defences[[/url]] and [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/boshin_art_armstrong_guns.html&quot;]]field artillery pieces[[/url]]. On the battlefield you can vary the shot type used with the buttons that appear alongside [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/060_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities.html&quot;]]abilities[[/url]] above the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/047_enc_manual_battle_conflict.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_review&quot;]]battle review panel[[/url]]. The four shot types are:&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solid Shot Shell – This is the default projectile for ships. It has a cast iron shell that doesn’t contain explosives, but still has the power to penetrate [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/boshin_corvette_kasuga.html&quot;]]wooden hulls[[/url]], although with only average accuracy.&lt;p&gt;Explosive Shell – This is a high explosive shell that is extremely good for penetrating the hulls of wooden ships or already-depleted crews. Although it is a low accuracy weapon with a small area of effect, it is still the perfect shell for firing at densely-packed clusters of ships.&lt;p&gt;Armour-piercing Shell – This is a high velocity armour-piercing shell that can easily penetrate the hulls of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/boshin_corvette_kasuga_iron_plated.html&quot;]]iron-plated ships[[/url]]. It is less powerful than an explosive shell but more accurate.&lt;p&gt;Advanced Armour-piercing Shell – This is a high velocity armour-piercing shell that is also highly explosive. It is effective when fired at all hull types, even [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/boshin_ironclad_hms_warrior.html&quot;]]ironclads[[/url]].&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_naval_shells.html#s2_bosh_tut_battle_naval_13&quot;]]here[[/url]] to view a video tutorial about this subject.</content>

The [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/046_enc_manual_battle_deployment.html#enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_zones&quot;]]deployment zone[[/url]] of the attacker will be outside the walls, the defender's will be around the keep.

<content>When besieged by the enemy an existing garrison will be bolstered by specially spawned defence units, representing the retainers of the clan, which will automatically disappear again after the battle. Although defence units do not retain any experience they gain during a siege, they are fully replenished the next time they are called to fight. The number of units provided depends on the level of the castle. The types and number of units are as follows:&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fort: 1 unit of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/inf_sword_samurai_retainers.html&quot;]]samurai retainers[[/url]]&lt;p&gt;Stronghold: 1 unit of samurai retainers; 1 unit of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/inf_spear_yari_ashigaru_citizenry.html&quot;]]yari ashigaru garrison[[/url]]&lt;p&gt;Fortress: 1 unit of samurai retainers; 2 units of yari ashigaru garrison; 1 unit of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/inf_missile_bow_ashigaru_citizenry.html&quot;]]bow ashigaru garrison[[/url]]&lt;p&gt;Castle: 2 units of samurai retainers; 2 units of yari ashigaru garrison; 2 units of bow ashigaru garrison; 1 unit of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/inf_heavy_onna_bushi.html&quot;]]onna bushi[[/url]]&lt;p&gt;Citadel: 3 units of samurai retainers; 3 units of yari ashigaru garrison; 4 units of bow ashigaru garrison; 1 unit of onna bushi&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers are modified by the presence of certain legendary buildings and the number of units already present in a  garrison when a siege begins (up to a maximum of 20), so if you are entitled to 12 defence units, but have an existing garrison of 10 units, 10 defence units are provided. When a legendary building is present it provides one additional defence unit (which takes the place of the weakest one provided by the castle if the size of the defence force is limited by the size of the existing garrison). The types and number of units are as follows:&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legendary bajutsu school: 1 unit of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/cav_spear_yari_cavalry.html&quot;]]yari cavalry[[/url]]&lt;p&gt;Legendary kyudo school: 1 unit of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/inf_missile_bow_samurai.html&quot;]]bow samurai[[/url]]&lt;p&gt;Legendary sojutsu school: 1 unit of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/inf_spear_yari_samurai.html&quot;]]yari samurai[[/url]]&lt;p&gt;Legendary kenjutsu school: 1 unit of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/inf_sword_katana_samurai.html&quot;]]katana samurai[[/url]]&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are slightly different rules for the Ikko Ikki, whose buildings provide naginata warrior monks as defence units, who will automatically replace the weakest defence unit(s) provided by the castle. The types and numbers of units are as follows:&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jodo shinshu temple: 1 unit of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/inf_heavy_naginata_warrior_monks_citizenry.html&quot;]]Ikko Ikki naginata warrior monks garrison[[/url]]&lt;p&gt;Jodo shinshu monastery: 2 units of Ikko Ikki naginata warrior monk garrison&lt;p&gt;Jodo shinshu sanctuary: 3 units of Ikko Ikki naginata warrior monk garrison&lt;p&gt;Honganji: 4 units of Ikko Ikki naginata warrior monk garrison</content>

<content>In Fall of the Samurai it is possible to increase the defensive capabilities of a castle by upgrading its tower defences. In battle, towers fire automatically and do not require the presence of a [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/057_enc_manual_battle_conflict_sieges.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_sieges_units_boshin&quot;]]garrison[[/url]], but can also be selected and controlled as if they were a unit. They can also be captured and turned against their owners or destroyed to render them useless to either side. Each [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/057_enc_manual_battle_conflict_sieges.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_towers&quot;]]tower upgrade[[/url]] improves the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/bosh_enc_ammo_types.html&quot;]]ordnance[[/url]] used; each [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/buildings/bos_castle_3_fortress.html&quot;]]castle upgrade[[/url]] improves the tower structure itself. The possible towers are as follows:&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archer Towers&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archer towers come as the default tower defences with all levels of castle, acting as an in-built defence against a besieging enemy. Occupied by archers, they automatically shoot arrows at any nearby foe. However, as the commander you can select them and order attacks on specific targets. In addition, archer towers have the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/060i_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_arrow_land.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_arrow_land&quot;]]fire arrow ability[[/url]], triggered via the dedicated button on the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/047_enc_manual_battle_conflict.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_review&quot;]]battle review panel[[/url]].&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matchlock Towers&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matchlock towers act as an in-built defence against a besieging enemy. Occupied by matchlock-armed troops, they automatically fire bullets at any nearby foe. However, as the commander you can select them and order attacks on specific targets.

Occupied by Gatling gun crews, they automatically fire bullets at high speed at any nearby foe. However, as the commander you can select them and order attacks on specific targets. In addition, Gatling gun towers have the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/bosh_enc_abilities_firing_speed.html&quot;]]increased firing speed ability[[/url]], triggered via the dedicated button on the battle review panel.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battery Towers&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battery towers act as an in-built defence against a besieging enemy. Occupied by gun-armed troops, they are unique in that they can switch between two firing methods. The former being Gatling guns (firing bullets at high speed) or, alternatively, gun batteries (which fire cannon balls at any nearby foe). As the commander, you can select them and order attacks on specific targets. In addition, battery towers have the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/bosh_enc_abilities_fast_reload.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_fast_reload&quot;]]fast reload ability[[/url]], triggered via the dedicated button on the battle review panel.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_siege_assault.html#s2_bosh_tut_battle_siege_11&quot;]]here[[/url]] to view a video tutorial about this subject.</content>

<content>Weather conditions should be considered when fighting a battle. They are displayed on the battlefield at the point of deployment along with a summary of their effects, so you can make an informed choice about fighting in certain conditions before joining battle. Wet conditions will affect the usefulness of gunpowder and other missile weapons only when playing in single player mode. This means that [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/060i_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_arrow_land.html&quot;]]fire arrows[[/url]] will not work (and therefore cannot be used by either side) and any units that use [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/inf_missile_matchlock_ashigaru.html&quot;]]gunpowder weapons[[/url]] will have increased loading times. [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/053_enc_manual_battle_conflict_fatigue.html&quot;]]Fatigued[[/url]] units also recover more slowly in the wet or snow. It is also much more difficult to set a building or ship alight in the rain, and by the same token anything on fire will be extinguished more quickly due to the downpour. Those [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/medium_ship_sengoku_bune.html&quot;]]ships with sails[[/url]] can be blown-off course if the prevailing winds are strong. Naturally, this does not affect the majority of available vessels as they are powered by oars. Mists and fog may occur close to ground level or the surface of water, affecting the range and accuracy of missiles. Enemy units (not ships) will be concealed if they are 600 metres away or further.</content>

Foreign trading districts improve both trade income and local growth, increase [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/014_enc_manual_hud_arts.html#enc_text_manual_hud_boshin_modernisation&quot;]]modernisation[[/url]], enable the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/018a_enc_manual_actions_campaign_recruitment.html&quot;]]recruitment[[/url]] of foreign troops, and provide a resource and clan-wide effect particular to the nation running them. Their presence will cause [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/020_enc_manual_public_order.html&quot;]]unrest[[/url]] in host provinces. Once three districts belonging to one nation have been constructed there is a chance that a military mission for that nation will be offered. Accepting it locks your clan into a military pact with the mission-giver, reducing the cost and time needed to recruit their troops and contributing to your clan’s capacity for modernisation. This can only happen once, and it is not possible to enter pacts with more than one nation.</content>

<content>Since diplomacy with and war against other [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_clan&quot;]]clans[[/url]] can only be undertaken when your respective territories are adjacent, you can increase your line of sight by sending fleets further along the coast or [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html&quot;]]agents[[/url]] into unknown lands to encounter new clans. However, be careful not to go too far without back-up - you may fall foul of hostile neighbours or suffer [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/030_enc_manual_army_attrition.html&quot;]]attrition[[/url]] if your ships stray too far from the coast.</content>

<class>textblock</class>
<content>In Shogun 2, food is a driving force of both the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/019a_enc_manual_province_wealth.html&quot;]]economy[[/url]] and [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/020_enc_manual_public_order.html&quot;]]public order[[/url]] of your clan. Food is spread across all the provinces you control, so the output of a high level [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/018e_enc_manual_actions_campaign_construction.html#enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_infrastructure_farms&quot;]]farm[[/url]] may be shared out between other provinces in your domain. [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/018e_enc_manual_actions_campaign_construction.html#enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_castle&quot;]]Castle towns[[/url]] are the chief consumer of food; the higher the level of castle town, the larger its population and therefore the larger the amount of food consumed. High level buildings of the market chain also consume food. Food is produced by farms; the higher the level of farm, the larger the amount of food produced. It is essential to strike a balance between food production and consumption as food shortages at a castle town will quickly damage public order and lead to [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/020_enc_manual_public_order.html#enc_text_manual_public_order_rebellions&quot;]]insurrection[[/url]].&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a clan’s food supply is short (indicated by a negative number in the bottom right-hand corner of the campaign map next to their income) the size of the food shortage is the deciding factor in the number of provinces affected by it (e.g. -1 = one province, -2 = two provinces, etc.) Each affected province will get a negative public order factor that increases by one during each subsequent turn. Doing nothing to address food shortages always leads to rebellion eventually.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When there is a surplus of food this is translated into growth (e.g. 1 = one point of growth). A food surplus of 0 means a balance between production and consumption has been found.</content>

<content>A trade agreement is a deal between two [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_clan&quot;]]clans[[/url]] agreeing the type and price of commodities to be traded. The details of such an agreement are not visible to the player, you simply set it up - the rest of the negotiation is implied by the other party's acceptance. Once agreed, a trade route is opened between the territory of your clan and that of your trade partner, enabling goods to be traded straight away for mutual advantage and profit. A trade agreement can be both offered and demanded.</content>

<content>Vassals are [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_clan&quot;]]clans[[/url]] who agree to exchange 50% of their income and unlimited [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/015c1_enc_manual_hud_diplomacy_access.html&quot;]]military access[[/url]] in return for the protection the military might of their overlord affords. The net result of this is that vassals may find themselves dragged into conflicts not of their own design, and unlike regular [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/015c_enc_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_alliance.html&quot;]]allies[[/url]], cannot decline a request to fight for their overlord without automatically declaring war on them. Clans do not usually offer themselves as vassals, the situation is generally forced upon them as part of a diplomatic deal that is more of a thinly-veiled threat than a fair and balanced offer. </content>

Never declare war without first considering the consequences, as an ill-prepared assault could have consequences resulting in your reduction to [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/015e_enc_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_vassals.html&quot;]]vassal[[/url]] status or worse, the annihilation of your clan. Note that when making your declaration the check box asking [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/015c_enc_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_alliance.html&quot;]]allies[[/url]] to join you is defaulted to yes.

<content>Periodically, European traders - the nanban - will try to instigate trade with you. If you accept their overtures and construct a nanban trade port it will eventually be possible to change your clan’s official religion to Christianity. Conversion will give you access to cheaper matchlock ashigaru that will take less time to recruit, but may alienate you from own people and, to some extent, traditional Buddhist clans. However, it is possible to keep Buddhist buildings in your provinces to appease the more traditional elements of your population. Christianity will also enable you to construct a nanban quarter at your port, giving you access to European cannon and ships. Convert religion by going to the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/016_enc_manual_hud_management.html#enc_text_manual_hud_management_family&quot;]]family &amp; council tab[[/url]] on the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/016_enc_manual_hud_management.html&quot;]]clan management panel[[/url]] and clicking on the dedicated button in the top left-hand corner. Remember that if you capture a province containing buildings of a different religion that their influence will still be felt, so it is best to demolish them and ensure an adequate garrison is in place to manage the shift to your own religion.</content>

The civic ones are: development - in charge of construction, who reduces construction costs, and finance - in charge of the clan's coffers, who increases the tax rate across your territory. The effects of the commissions are increased depending on the rank of the men holding them, so a four star general makes a more powerful commissioner than one with a single star.</content>

<content>In Total War: Shogun 2, the multiplayer mode revolves around the creation and progression of an avatar - a direct representation of you that leads your armies during campaigns and battles. Your avatar can be fully customised to your specifications. He is a ronin warlord who gains rank, [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/background.html&quot;]]skills[[/url]], [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/popup_armor_sets.html&quot;]]equipment[[/url]] and [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/ancillaries_background.html&quot;]]retainers[[/url]] as he progresses, building his own warband of hardy [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/mp_army_management.html&quot;]]veterans[[/url]] who can be selected for use in any given battle. Veteran units can even be renamed and re-coloured as you wish, and will gain levels of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/031_enc_manual_army_experience.html&quot;]]experience[[/url]] allowing them to progress through their own individual skill trees.

Via the clan manager button in the multiplayer mode, choose from a list of Steam Groups you are currently a member of and nominate one of them to be your clan. You can prevent players from making the Steam Group their clan by ensuring that the group is private, so that only those whom you invite can join.

<content>To succeed in the clan competition your clan must acquire influence points from the provinces on the map. Each victory recorded whilst playing a [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/solo_setup.html&quot;]]match-made battle[[/url]] will award your clan with the clan influence points shown on the tooltip when you mouse over that province. Every one of your clan members contributes to this total number of points from each province. The clan that has the most total clan influence points in any given province owns that province.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you lose a battle your clan loses 50% of the points that would’ve been gained for a victory in that province. Clan influence in a province can never fall below zero.</content>

<class>textblock</class>
<content>The clan competition is arranged into several tiers – tier one being the top tier. Each tier consists of a number of game worlds each containing twenty-four clans. The system is arranged in a pyramid, where each successive tier contains double the number of game worlds.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clan competition is divided into seasons. At the end of each season, the clans at the top of a game world are promoted to the next highest tier and the clans at the bottom are demoted to the next lowest tier. A clan’s position on the league table within a game world is determined by the number of provinces that clan owns. Where two clans have an equal number of provinces, the clan with most total battle victories will be placed higher on the ladder. Once a new season begins, the game world will refresh. The time remaining in the current season is displayed at the foot of the league table.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also view your clan’s position within the overall clan competition by using the navigation buttons above the league table.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_multiplayer_clans.html#s2_bosh_tut_multiplayer_26&quot;]]here[[/url]] to view a video tutorial about this subject.</content>

<class>textblock</class>
<content>A co-operative campaign allows two players to play a full campaign against AI opponents. It is largely similar to a standard multiplayer campaign, with the addition of a shared victory condition: both co-op partners must retain possession of their capital, but required provincial conquests are shared between them. Diplomatic states are also shared between partners, meaning that if one declares war against an AI clan, their partner will also be at war with that AI clan. Similarly, ceasefires and alliances will also be shared. Within a partnership, the field of view on the campaign map will be shared, including line of sight from units and buildings, and the unveiling of the hidden sections of the campaign map.</content>

<content>During a co-op campaign, it is possible for players to share troops during their battles. Simply select a unit on the battlefield in the usual way, then click the gift units button in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. Control of those units will be transferred to your co-op partner for the duration of that battle. This process works both ways so that partners can swap troops back and forth between them as often as they like during a battle. Even if one player has no troops involved, he can still enter the battle and be ready to receive shared units whenever his partner is ready. Once the battle is over, shared units return to the control of the partner who recruited them.</content>

Note that you can only place your army on a land province and your fleet on a sea province, and these must be adjacent to a land or sea province you have already explored. You can now find an equally-matched opponent via the match-made battle button. You can choose to fight a 1-on-1 battle or participate in a team battle. Selecting a sea battle type will mean that you are fighting to explore the sea region your fleet currently occupies, whereas land and siege battle types will take place wherever your army marker has been placed. The battle list button allows you to search for or host custom battles, although these are commonly less well-matched than match made battles and don’t contribute toward your skill rating. Fighting and winning a battle in a selected province will mean that your [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/061_enc_manual_multiplayer.html&quot;]]avatar[[/url]] has explored this province and gained access to any [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/ancillaries_background.html&quot;]]retainers[[/url]] or buildings situated there.

Unlike other recruits in your [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/061_enc_manual_multiplayer.html&quot;]]avatar's[[/url]] army, veterans stay with him throughout his career.

Keep [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/013_enc_manual_hud_finances.html&quot;]]taxes[[/url]] at reasonable levels, maintain sufficient food levels and ensure that castle towns or settlements (in Fall of the Samurai) are garrisoned to stop public order bubbling over into rioting or worse, full-scale rebellion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_camp_essentials_occupation.html#s2_bosh_tut_camp_essentials_16&quot;]]here[[/url]] to view a video tutorial about this subject.</content>

<content>There are two types of rebellion. A general whose loyalty has dropped too low may attempt to form his own [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_clan&quot;]]clan[[/url]] rather than defect to another. If this happens, he will raise an army and try to capture the nearest castle town. The army will mostly consist of [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_samurai&quot;]]samurai[[/url]] with some [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_ashigaru&quot;]]ashigaru[[/url]]. Riots amongst the peasants can also escalate into full-scale rebellions, happening when a third of the unhappiness in a province is due to [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/045a_enc_manual_agent_actions_religious.html&quot;]]religious unrest[[/url]]. In the case of a [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_buddhism&quot;]]Buddhist[[/url]] rebellion, the army will mostly consist of monks and ashigaru; a Christian rebellion will mostly consist of ashigaru with some samurai. The size of the rebel army is always linked to the level of the castle town or settlement (in Fall of the Samurai) in the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_province&quot;]]province[[/url]] from which it has spawned.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_camp_essentials_occupation.html#s2_bosh_tut_camp_essentials_19&quot;]]here[[/url]] to view a video tutorial about this subject.</content>

It is, naturally, much more difficult to see what is going on at night, so the range of missile weapons is reduced, and an army will suffer a [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/052_enc_manual_battle_conflict_morale.html&quot;]]morale[[/url]] penalty if not led by a general who has the “Night Fighter” [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/043_enc_manual_traits.html&quot;]]trait[[/url]]. Any reinforcements will not be available in order to reflect the communication difficulties that arise when attempting to conduct a battle in the dark. Generals can acquire the ability to fight night battles by gaining the “Stealthy” [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/042_enc_manual_skills.html&quot;]]skill[[/url]]. They can be fought at sea after mastering the “Way of the Sea” [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/014_enc_manual_hud_arts.html&quot;]]art[[/url]]. It is only possible to conduct an [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/028_enc_manual_army_attack.html&quot;]]ambush[[/url]] at night if you are the attacker, never if you are the defender.</content>

<content>A very large army or fleet spread over two or more unit stacks may not be able to fight as a single force, as a [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_clan&quot;]]clan[[/url]] can only field a maximum of twenty units at one time. In this instance, additional units will arrive for battle piecemeal, joining the fray to replace units that have been [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/049_enc_manual_battle_conflict_controls.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_modes_routing&quot;]]routed[[/url]] or destroyed. [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/units/art_fire_projecting_mangonels.html&quot;]]Siege weapons[[/url]] cannot be used as reinforcements as they are fixed in position during the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/046_enc_manual_battle_deployment.html&quot;]]deployment phase[[/url]], so are therefore unable to move onto the battlefield once this phase is over.</content>

<content>A drop-in battle is a feature allowing a human opponent to take the place of the AI clan in a campaign battle or fight a battle in another's campaign in place of the AI. This is achieved via the on-line battle mechanism. If, when setting up your campaign, you check the option to search continuously for drop-in battles, you will occasionally receive an invitation to fight another player in a battle from their campaign. If accepted, your current campaign progress will be saved before you join them on the battlefield. Once the battle is over, the campaign automatically resumes where it was left off. Even if you do not check the option to continuously search, you will be able to find live opponents to fight in place of the AI in your own campaign by checking the drop-in battle box on the [[url=&quot;encyclopedia/how_to_play/032_enc_manual_ui_battle.html&quot;]]battle panel[[/url]].</content>
