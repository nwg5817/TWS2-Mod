<localised_description>Research is underway and we have been approached by numerous foreigners claiming to be experts in their field. We can exploit this to our advantage; should we seek to focus on civil or military development?</localised_description>
<localised_first_choice_label>Despite tensions, conflict has yet to escalate; there may never be a better time to develop our infrastructure. We will seek the counsel of experts in civil technology.</localised_first_choice_label>

<localised_second_choice_label>This conflict has yet to escalate, but all-out war is inevitable. When that day comes we must have the advantage. We will seek the counsel of experts in military technology.</localised_second_choice_label>

<localised_description>Merchants operating at our ports have proposed increased trade between our clan and foreign nations. They have requested permission to invest in overseas trade opportunities.</localised_description>
