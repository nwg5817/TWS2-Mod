<localised_description>Although it saddens me to see our culture diluted by the barbarian ways of the westerners, there are many advantages to embracing their technology. To conduct advanced research we must first increase our capacity for development by building up our civic and industrial infrastructure.</localised_description>

The Kono of Iyo are already moving against us; subjugating them first will avoid a war on two fronts. However, Awa province is a more strategically important target, being a source of superior warhorses. The choice is yours, my lord.</localised_description>

Kozuke province is held by our Yamanouchi vassals, but there are many other nearby provinces ripe for conquest. Of particular note are Etchu to the west, held by our Jinbo enemies, and the island of Sado, which holds riches invaluable to our expansion. The choice is yours, my lord.</localised_description>

<localised_description>Their ability to penetrate deep behind enemy lines without being detected enables ninja to put their sabotage skills to pertinent use.
