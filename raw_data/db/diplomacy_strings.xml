<key>Fujiwara_accept_friendly</key>
<string>The Fujiwara are honoured and pleased to accept this offer. May fortune favour our future dealings.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_accept_very_friendly</key>
<string>You are a blessing to your family, and to the Fujiwara. We accept whole-heartedly.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_acknowledge_marriage</key>
<string>A marriage between your family and the Fujiwara brings many advantages. Let it be done.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_approach_friendly</key>
<string>We would have dealings with you, as your honesty and worth mirror that of the Fujiwara clan.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_cancel_trade</key>
<string>My heart is heavy, but the Fujiwara no longer see any profit in trading with you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_generic_reject_1</key>
<string>This is unfortunate. We Fujiwara could not accept such an offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_generic_reject_2</key>
<string>While what you suggest has merits, we Fujiwara cannout accept it.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_not_interested_in_further_discussion</key>
<string>I must take my leave. Other family duties demand my attention if the interests of the Fujiwara are to be properly served.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_receive_friendly</key>
<string>Welcome! The Fujiwara pride themselves on remembering friends, and on honouring them.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_receive_very_friendly</key>
<string>It is good to see an honourable friend of the Fujiwara in these times! What shall we talk of?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_reject_demand_hostage</key>
<string>The Fujiwara do not sell their children into bondage. You will have no hostage today.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_reject_demand_military_access</key>
<string>Our Fujiwara ancestors would not sleep peacefully with your troops tramping across our hallowed lands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_reject_demand_protectorate</key>
<string>You are mistaken. Fujiwara pride, and history, would never allow such a thing.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Fujiwara_reject_offer_demand_peace</key>
<string>This is not the time to speak of peace. The sword of the Fujiwara has been drawn and it will not rest!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_acknowledge_war</key>
<string>Good! The House of Minamoto welcomes open, honest war with you!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_cancel_military_access</key>
<string>The Minamoto ancestors resent your soldiers disturbing their peace. Our lands are closed to you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_demand_military_access</key>
<string>You would be wise to allow Minamoto armies to march across your lands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_generic_reject_angry_1</key>
<string>No! Such scant fare would not sit well in Minamoto stomachs.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_receive_hostile</key>
<string>I will listen, but my Minamoto heart aches to see your blood spilled.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_reject_angry_demand_hostage</key>
<string>Minamoto flesh is not bought and sold in the market! There will be no hostage for you!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_reject_angry_demand_marriage</key>
<string>The Minamoto do not pimp their sons and daughters to the likes of you. There will be no marriage.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_reject_angry_demand_protectorate</key>
<string>The House of Minamoto does not bow to anyone, except the Emperor!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment</key>
<string>Ha! You are a court fool to ask this! You will not have one rusty nail from Minamoto lands!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_reject_angry_demand_single_payment</key>
<string>You will have nothing. We Minamoto do not pay for peace. Our swords guarantee our peace.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_reject_angry_offer_single_payment</key>
<string>We Minamoto are not court lackeys! We cannot be bought like cheap dancing girls!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_reject_demand_single_payment</key>
<string>Minamoto gold will stay in Minamoto strongrooms. We do not meekly hand it to robbers.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_reject_offer_hostage</key>
<string>Thank you, but no: we do not want your whelp cluttering up a Minamoto palace.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Minamoto_too_many_counters</key>
<string>Be silent now. You have babbled your nonsense into Minamoto ears until we are weary. We are done.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_accept_very_friendly</key>
<string>There is much to celebrate here. The Taira always appreciate honest dealings!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_acknowledge_accept</key>
<string>Our discussions are complete, and most satisfactory. And now, court business requires my attentionâ€¦</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_acknowledge_counter_accept</key>
<string>We Taira welcome your decision, and the wisdom that lies behind your choice.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_acknowledge_counter_reject</key>
<string>The House of Taira has better things to occupy its attention than you. Our talks are done.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_acknowledge_marriage</key>
<string>A marriage can bring only honour to both our families. The House of Taira welcomes you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_acknowledge_reject</key>
<string>I see. The House of Taira truly hopes that you will not live to regret this decision.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_demand_player_must_become_vassal</key>
<string>Be wise: accept the truth. You need a powerful protector, and the Lord of the Taira is that man. Be his vassal.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_demand_regular_payment</key>
<string>A regular contribution to the treasury of the House of Taira would show that intelligence is not lacking in your family.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_generic_reject_angry_1</key>
<string>This offer is a bad joke! Do you think the Taira have are weak scribes to be so insulted?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_offer_demand_alliance</key>
<string>Surely your enemies would quake to know you are an ally of the Taira. Accept our formal friendship and all will be well.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_offer_marriage</key>
<string>We offer you marriage, a union with the House of Taira: such an elevation should not be lightly refused.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_offer_single_payment</key>
<string>The wise courtier knows that a gift can often smooth the way between friends. Please, accept this measure of Taira esteem.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_receive_unfriendly</key>
<string>There are matters of state that need attention. What inconvenience do you bring to the House of Taira?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>Taira_reject_offer_demand_alliance</key>
<string>An alliance may seem worthy to you, but the House of Taira sees little profit in such an arrangement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_acknowledge_marriage</key>
<string>This marriage honours you and strengthens the Chosokabe!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_acknowledge_war</key>
<string>Honest, open war is better than mealy-mouthed peace. We will erect a monument to you, afterwards.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_cancel_trade</key>
<string>The Chosokabe no longer need your trade goods. Our arrangement is ended.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_not_interested_in_further_discussion</key>
<string>I see little point in talking further. Your ways are too subtle for me to comprehend their meaning.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_offer_demand_peace</key>
<string>Perhaps it is time to talk of peace. There is honour in peace made with strength.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_offer_demand_trade</key>
<string>You can surely see that trade brings both profit and friendship.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_offer_marriage</key>
<string>We offer the hand of a Chosokabe in marriage. What more could anyone want for his family?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_receive_friendly</key>
<string>Welcome! And what would you ask of the Chosokabe?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_reject_angry_demand_hostage</key>
<string>We do not give up our children to men such as you! The Chosokabe still believe in honour!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_reject_angry_demand_single_payment</key>
<string>So, you think the Chosokabe so stupid that they will agree to any theft, no matter how prettily phrased?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace</key>
<string>We are not stupid. Why have peace when you still have breath to ask for it?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_reject_demand_protectorate</key>
<string>We will not be ruled by other men. Chosokabe honour has meaning, or it is nothing.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_reject_offer_demand_peace</key>
<string>No, we are not so simple as to want peace just yet.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>chosokabe_reject_offer_single_payment</key>
<string>Your gold could not buy a Chosokabe nail paring, let alone our good opinion.</string>

<key>date_acknowledge_marriage</key>
<string>You gain much from our bloodline! Fortunately, the Date clan is also stronger as a result of this marriage.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_offer_demand_peace</key>
<string>An end to fighting does not diminish us, or you. It shows prudence and honour.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_reject_angry_demand_military_access</key>
<string>Never! Date lands are not your drill grounds!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_reject_angry_demand_protectorate</key>
<string>We are our own masters! Do not be foolish and confuse negotiating with weakness.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_reject_angry_demand_single_payment</key>
<string>Not one single coin will leave the Date treasury. Continue, and much blood will flow!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace</key>
<string>There can be no peace. We are fighters, not old women!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_reject_demand_hostage</key>
<string>No. There are no members of the Date clan who would be suitable for such an honour.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_reject_demand_military_access</key>
<string>We cannot allow that. Our warriors would, rightly, not suffer such shame in silence.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_reject_demand_protectorate</key>
<string>We are warriors. The Date do not bow to any unworthy men.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_reject_demand_single_payment</key>
<string>Ha! So you would rob us and call it diplomacy?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_reject_offer_demand_peace</key>
<string>No. You still live.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_reject_offer_marriage</key>
<string>A well-intentioned offer, but such a marriage is not possible for we Date.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_reject_offer_single_payment</key>
<string>Date honour is not bought with a handful of coins.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>date_war</key>
<string>We welcome war. Our warriors yearn for it, as you will shortly discover.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_acknowledge_war</key>
<string>Very well, let it be war. My profound condolences to your widows-to-be.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_approach_friendly</key>
<string>Let us build from strong foundations, and thrive together.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_cancel_military_access</key>
<string>Our lands have been unquiet with your troops in them. We cannot allow this to continue.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_demand_hostage</key>
<string>Let us put matters on a firm footing: provide us with a hostage, as guarantee of your good behaviour.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_offer_demand_peace</key>
<string>It is time to end the fighting, before both our houses lie entirely ruined.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_reject_angry_demand_hostage</key>
<string>We will not give even one of our people into your tender care. You must think us foolish indeed!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_reject_angry_demand_marriage</key>
<string>No Hojo marriage bed will ever be soiled by one of your whelps!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_reject_angry_demand_military_access</key>
<string>Never! Hojo lands and honour are not yours to trample as you see fit!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment</key>
<string>We do not need your money. Our lands are quite wealthy enough without taking payments from peasants.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_reject_angry_offer_single_payment</key>
<string>We may be known as builders, but we are not tradesmen to be bought in this fashion!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_reject_demand_protectorate</key>
<string>We cannot do such a thing. The very stones of our land would cry out against it.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_reject_offer_demand_alliance</key>
<string>Such an alliance would be built without foundations. It would collapse in the merest breeze.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_reject_offer_single_payment</key>
<string>No. Gifts honour the giver, but not in this case. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>hojo_war</key>
<string>The Hojo have nevered feared war. They will not start now.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>iga_ninja_accept_hostile</key>
<string>I would as soon drive a tanto into your heart, but this agreement must be accepted.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>iga_ninja_acknowledge_hostage</key>
<string>The Hattori understand such things. The matter will be arranged.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>iga_ninja_acknowledge_war</key>
<string>So be it! Now you will learn to fear the shadows!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>iga_ninja_demand_single_payment</key>
<string>There is much to be said for turning aside the resentment of others with golden blossoms.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>iga_ninja_generic_reject_angry_1</key>
<string>Ah! If only good manners allowed me to carve this rejection into your skull!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>iga_ninja_generic_reject_angry_2</key>
<string>We Hattori are not fools. This will be remembered.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>

<string>Even now the clouds gather around the mountain tops, and sensible men go home.</string>

<string>What do you want? Speak, if you value your tongue!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>iga_ninja_receive_unfriendly</key>
<string>Why have you come? Why should the Hattori listen to your words?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>iga_ninja_reject_angry_demand_marriage</key>
<string>No Hattori could be persuaded to bed one of your creatures!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>iga_ninja_reject_angry_demand_military_access</key>
<string>Hattori lands are not some pleasure garden for you to wander in as you see fit! </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>iga_ninja_reject_angry_demand_single_payment</key>
<string>We do not give others gold, only steel. And in darkness.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>iga_ninja_reject_angry_offer_demand_alliance</key>
<string>To what end would the Hattori want you as allies? Target practice, perhaps?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>iga_ninja_war</key>
<string>When next you wake, if you wake, you will regret the decision to fight us, the Hattori!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>ikko_ikki_accept_friendly</key>
<string>A proposal as straight and true as an arrow's shaft! We accept. May good fortune favour us all.</string>

<string>We accept, even though you are lower than a snake's belly.</string>

<string>May this marriage further strengthen the bond between us.</string>

<string>Your armies must never enter our lands again. They offend the people, the spirits and the heavens!</string>

<string>Like all nobles, you have talked and said nothing. This is ended.</string>

<string>Speak carefully, for you walk along the edge of a volcano!</string>

<string>Marriage? To one of yours? Oh, no, no, no.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>

<key>ikko_ikki_reject_angry_demand_protectorate</key>
<string>A rotten fish still stinks, even when dressed in the finest silk. Why would we want to be your slaves?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>

<string>We will never be your slaves and servants. Find others to bow to you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>

<string>No. Our children are precious.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>

<string>Peace? It is peace you want? We do not see the need for your peace!</string>

<string>War it is, then. Now you will feel the people's righteous fury!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_accept_friendly_01</key>
<string>A proposal as straight and true as an arrow's shaft! The Emperor will accept.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_accept_friendly_02</key>
<string>Your words are entirely sensible. I gladly accept on the Emperor's behalf.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_accept_hostile_01</key>
<string>The Imperial Court will accept these terms, even though you are lower than a snake's belly. I will bear the dishonour.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_accept_hostile_02</key>
<string>I will carry the shame of our acceptance. The Emperor's reputation will remain intact.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_accept_hostile_03</key>
<string>I am sure court will be angered, but we must agree with your proposal. For now.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_accept_hostile_08</key>
<string>Your proposal is, at best, disrespectful to His Majesty, but I will accept it. Abide your given word!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_accept_neutral_07</key>
<string>I accept on behalf of the Imperial Court. There: it is done. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_02</key>
<string>I do not care for you or yours, but I will persuade the court to agree. That must be enough.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_03</key>
<string>I still have reservations, but I will tell His Majesty that we have reached agreement here today.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_accept_very_friendly_02</key>
<string>Ah! Men like you should be serving His Majesty! We have an agreement, and honest friendship!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_acknowledge_accept_01</key>
<string>A most satisfactory end to our discussions. I express His Majesty's thanks for him.</string>

<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_alliance_01</key>
<string>Our alliance is ended. The next time we meet may be with guns and swords rather than tea cups.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_trade_03</key>
<string>Very well. Trade is beneath Imperial dignity anyway. It is over.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_reject_02</key>
<string>This is unfortunate. And I have know ladies discussing kimonos act with more decisiveness.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_reject_06</key>
<string>So we are done, then. So much for talking. I expressed concerns to His Majesty about just this outcomeâ€¦</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_01</key>
<string>May this marriage further strengthen the bonds of loyalty to the Emperor.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_02</key>
<string>Marriage should be a time of happiness. Let this one increase the happiness and trust in all our hearts.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_03</key>
<string>A marriage is a sign of the sincerity in all our hearts. We agree.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_04</key>
<string>This marriage should do much to ease any difficulties between you and the Imperial Court.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_05</key>
<string>A marriage is a welcome sign of better times to come. I wish the couple much joy.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_06</key>
<string>Politics and the marriage bed: they are a start towards better things, I trust.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_acknowledge_reject_03</key>
<string>Your decision is a courageous one, but I will carry word back to the Imperial Court.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_approach_friendly_02</key>
<string>Greetings, noble friend. I have come with a proposal from His Majesty that should also meet with your approval.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_approach_hostile_03</key>
<string>His Majesty commands me speak, and I obey, although I would sooner treat with ice-hearted demons.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_approach_neutral_07</key>
<string>The Emperor would know your mind on some trifling matters. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_approach_neutral_09</key>
<string>My words today carry the weight of Imperial authority. Listen with care.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_approach_neutral_10</key>
<string>My words are an offer from His Majesty's generous heart. Listen, and consider it with care.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_04</key>
<string>His Majesty sends greetings. He also sends a noble proposal. You should listen.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_05</key>
<string>I have come in search of wisdom in response to His Majesty's proposal. I hope this is not a vain exercise.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_08</key>
<string>I speak at the court's behest. Its honour is indeed great, to send a proposal to such as you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_02</key>
<string>Recognising your worth, the Emperor sends gracious felicitations, and instructs me to make you an offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_08</key>
<string>I bear greetings, and His Majesty's offer. Perhaps you will listen with wisdom and proper respect.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_09</key>
<string>His Majesty sends his best wishes, and hopes that we may reach further harmony.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_cancel_military_access_01</key>
<string>The spirits of Japan are unquiet. We can no longer allow your armies to disturb our tranquility.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_cancel_trade_02</key>
<string>Regretfully, Imperial edicts now forbid your merchants from further trade.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_counter_accept_02</key>
<string>Your words have merit, as His Majesty will surely see. I accept your counter-proposal.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_counter_reject_02</key>
<string>Your words lack substance, and I will risk Imperial displeasure by rejecting them immediately.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_demand_player_must_become_vassal_02</key>
<string>I will be plain: your future is bleak without a protector. Become an Imperial vassal, and secure your future.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_generic_reject_1_02</key>
<string>I will not trouble the Emperor with the decision to reject this offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_generic_reject_1_07</key>
<string>Your offer does little for the dignity of the Chrysanthemum Throne. Harmony would be lessened by our agreement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_generic_reject_2_02</key>
<string>Such an offer would not be acceptable within Imperial circles. I will not raise the matter with the Court.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_03</key>
<string>This proposal is quite interesting, but completely out of the question as far as His Majesty is concerned.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_04</key>
<string>All your words are a disguised insult to the Chrysanthemum Throne, not a sincere offer. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_05</key>
<string>You must think His Majesty's servants are simple. I will only reply: &quot;no&quot;.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_offer_demand_trade_02</key>
<string>Trade is beneath Imperial dignity, but allowing our merchants to work would be sensible.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_offer_marriage_02</key>
<string>A marriage into the Imperial family would benefit all, for it would be a sign of trust between us.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_offer_marriage_05</key>
<string>Perhaps you would consider a marriage into the Imperial family. Such a thing would do much to foster good relations.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_receive_unfriendly_02</key>
<string>I have other court duties, you know. Speak quickly, so that I may be about something useful today.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_receive_unfriendly_06</key>
<string>Speak, then, and do so with despatch. I have other pressing business with court officials.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_hostage_01</key>
<string>Imperial flesh and blood are not traded like cattle! There will be no hostage!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_marriage_01</key>
<string>I cannot think of any rational reason why one of your family should be allowed to marry so far above their station.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_marriage_03</key>
<string>Why on earth would we link the Imperial family to anyone so far beneath them in blood and honour?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_marriage_06</key>
<string>Ha! Never. The Imperial children will marry dung collectors before we consider any of your whelps!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_02</key>
<string>Ah! You are a clan of merchants then! Well, the Emperor does not deal with merchants, ever!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_reject_demand_military_access_02</key>
<string>Sadly, I do not think the Emperor would want his peace disturbed by the marching of your men.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_reject_offer_marriage_02</key>
<string>An arranged marriage. I do not think this would work. The Emperor must maintain Imperial dignity.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_imperial_monarchy_reject_offer_regular_payment_02</key>
<string>No. I do not think the Emperor would sell his dignity, like some tradesman. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_accept_friendly_01</key>
<string>A proposal as straight and true as an arrow's shaft! The Shogunate accepts your offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_accept_friendly_02</key>
<string>Your words are entirely sensible. I gladly accept on the Shogunate's behalf.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_accept_hostile_01</key>
<string>Even though you are lower than a snake's belly we accept this offer. The dishonour is mine alone.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_accept_hostile_02</key>
<string>I will carry the shame of our acceptance. The Shogun's reputation will remain intact.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_accept_hostile_03</key>
<string>The Shogunate must agree with your proposal. For now.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_accept_neutral_07</key>
<string>I accept on behalf of my Shogun. There: it is done. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_02</key>
<string>I do not care for you or yours, but I will persuade the Shogun to agree. That must be enough.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_03</key>
<string>I still have reservations, but I will tell the Shogun that we have an agreement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_accept_very_friendly_02</key>
<string>Your people are blessed to be served by you. We have an agreement, and honest friendship!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_alliance_01</key>
<string>Our alliance is ended. The next time we meet may be with guns and swords rather than tea cups.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_01</key>
<string>May this marriage further strengthen the bond between us.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_02</key>
<string>Marriage should be a time of happiness. Let this one increase the happiness and trust between us.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_03</key>
<string>A marriage is a sign of the sincerity in all our hearts. We agree.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_04</key>
<string>This marriage should do much to ease any difficulties between us.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_acknowledge_reject_03</key>
<string>Your decision is a courageous one, but I will carry word of it to the Shogun.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_approach_friendly_02</key>
<string>Greetings, noble friend. I have come with a proposal from the Shogun that should also meet with your approval.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_approach_hostile_03</key>
<string>The Shogun commands me speak, and I obey, although I would sooner speak with barbarous foreigners.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_approach_neutral_07</key>
<string>The Shogun sends me to deal with you on some trifling matters. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_approach_neutral_09</key>
<string>My words today carry the weight of the Shogunate's authority. Listen with care.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_approach_neutral_10</key>
<string>My words are an offer from the Shogun's noble heart. Listen, and consider it with care.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_04</key>
<string>The Shogun sends greetings. In this he is too generous. He also sends a proposal. You should listen.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_05</key>
<string>I have come in search of wisdom in response to this proposal. I hope this is not a vain exercise.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_08</key>
<string>I speak on the Shogunate's behalf, an honour indeed. So perhaps you should listen.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_02</key>
<string>Recognising your worth, the Shogun sends greetings, and instructs me to make you an offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_08</key>
<string>I bear greetings, and the Shogun's offer. Perhaps you will listen with wisdom and friendship.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_09</key>
<string>The Shogun sends his best wishes, and hopes that we may reach further agreement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_cancel_military_access_02</key>
<string>Your troops disturb the dignity of the Shogunate. It is time for them to leave our lands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_cancel_trade_02</key>
<string>Regretfully, the Shogun now forbids his merchants from trading with your merchants.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_counter_accept_02</key>
<string>Your words have merit, and I am sure the Shogun will approve. I accept your counter-proposal.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_demand_player_must_become_vassal_02</key>
<string>I will be plain: your future is bleak without a protector. Become a vassal of the Shogunate, and secure your well-being.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_generic_reject_1_02</key>
<string>On the Shogun's behalf, I will decline this offer. I will not trouble him with the decision.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_generic_reject_1_07</key>
<string>Your offer does little for the Shogunate. Our harmony would be lessened by accepting.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_generic_reject_2_02</key>
<string>Such an offer would not be acceptable to the Shogun. I will not bring the matter to his attention.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_04</key>
<string>All your words disguised only an insult to the Shogunate, not a sincere offer. And insulted, we refuse you anything.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_offer_marriage_05</key>
<string>Perhaps you would consider a marriage. Such a thing would do much to foster good relations.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_marriage_01</key>
<string>I must tell you that the Shogun would sooner see a leatherworker wed to one of his own.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_marriage_06</key>
<string>Ha! Never. The Shogun's children will marry dung collectors before they consider any of your whelps!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_02</key>
<string>Ah! You are a clan of merchants then! Well, the Shogunate does not deal with merchants, or pay them without reason!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_reject_demand_military_access_02</key>
<string>Sadly, I do not think the Shogun would want his peace disturbed by the marching of your men.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_reject_offer_marriage_02</key>
<string>An arranged marriage. I do not think this would work. The Shogun is quite particular about his relatives.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_reject_offer_regular_payment_02</key>
<string>No. I do not think the Shogun would accept payment, like some tradesman. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_fots_shogun_monarchy_reject_offer_regular_payment_04</key>
<string>We do not care to be thought of as cheap foreigners, to be bought off for a handful of coins.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_friendly</key>
<string>A proposal as straight and true as an arrow's shaft! My lord will accept. May good fortune favour us all.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_friendly_02</key>
<string>Your words are entirely sensible. I gladly accept on my lord's behalf.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_friendly_03</key>
<string>We can agree to such a sensible and correct proposal. Our thanks for your wisdom.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_friendly_04</key>
<string>A wise proposal, and one that favours us all. We accept!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_friendly_05</key>
<string>The good sense of your words cannot be denied. We accept, my friend.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_friendly_06</key>
<string>Ah! This is a good end to our negotiations. We are in friendly agreement and all is well.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_friendly_07</key>
<string>So we have agreement then! It is good when friends treat each other with respect!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_friendly_08</key>
<string>An excellent suggestion. I agree. Wisdom and respect have prevailed. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_friendly_09</key>
<string>So we are done, and we have a most acceptable agreement - and all in the spirit of friendship!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_friendly_10</key>
<string>You have shown friendship and respect here today. How can I do less? I agree.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_hostile</key>
<string>My lord will accept, even though you are lower than a snake's belly. I will carry the dishonour of this decision for him.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_hostile_02</key>
<string>I will carry the shame of our acceptance. My lord's reputation will remain intact.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_hostile_03</key>
<string>I am sure my lord will be angry, but we must agree with your proposal. For now.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_hostile_04</key>
<string>My stomach troubles me. Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦  I agree. See that you keep your word!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_hostile_05</key>
<string>I can see vile treachery in your heart even as I say this: we agree. Bah!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_hostile_06</key>
<string>I see that we have no choice but to accept, though it makes my heart ache to do it.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_hostile_07</key>
<string>We have reached agreement. Let us speak no more. I would bathe and get your stink off my flesh.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_hostile_08</key>
<string>Your proposal is, at best, disrespectful, but I will accept it. See that you abide by what you have said!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_hostile_09</key>
<string>Any shame for accepting this agreement will be on my head. Any shame for breaking it, on yours!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_hostile_10</key>
<string>I would sooner take the word of a fox, but I must agree.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_neutral</key>
<string>We have reached agreement, then, although the sake has unfortunately run out and we cannot celebrate.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_neutral_02</key>
<string>So, we are in agreement then. Honesty and respect have informed our dealings.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_neutral_03</key>
<string>This is acceptable. When honest men deal honestly with each other, we can reach agreement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_neutral_04</key>
<string>An acceptable offer. It is good to speak plainly, is it not?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_neutral_05</key>
<string>Your words are acceptable, and we are in agreement. There is no more.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_neutral_06</key>
<string>No more talk! The deal is done. Let us leave matters here, and go our separate ways.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_neutral_07</key>
<string>I accept on behalf of my clan. There: it is done. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_neutral_08</key>
<string>Your terms are acceptable. Let us see what the future brings.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_neutral_09</key>
<string>Talk no more. Your offer will be accepted. Be glad of what you have achieved today.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_neutral_10</key>
<string>No more. No more. There is nothing more to say. We accept.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_unfriendly</key>
<string>Against all reason, we agree. We are not friends, but we are not enemies. That will have to suffice.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_02</key>
<string>I do not care for you or yours, but I will persuade my lord to agree. That must be enough.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_03</key>
<string>I still have reservations, but I will tell my lord that we have reached agreement here today.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_04</key>
<string>My heart is full of foreboding that this will be an evil thing, but I accept.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_05</key>
<string>I accept your terms, although it is an ill-done act. I hope no further ill comes of it.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_06</key>
<string>An end to this tittle-tattle! The deal is done. Do not look for anything more.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_07</key>
<string>Enough! Your words are wearisome, but I accept your proposal. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_08</key>
<string>I would prefer the word of a gentleman, but I must take yours. I will agree to your terms.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_09</key>
<string>I will accept your terms. My heart tells me that you are false, but we shall see.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_unfriendly_10</key>
<string>I accept your offer. See to it that you honour your side of the bargain!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_very_friendly</key>
<string>It is heartening to see honour still exists in these treacherous times: you are a blessing to your clan. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_very_friendly_02</key>
<string>Your lord is blessed to be served by men like you. We have an agreement, and honest friendship!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_very_friendly_03</key>
<string>And so we have an agreement! When friendship and statecraft meet, how could it be otherwise?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_very_friendly_04</key>
<string>Let me be the first to express agreement with what is proposed. This is an auspicious day!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_very_friendly_05</key>
<string>I accept! Your terms are even-handed and fair, your words respectful and becoming to your honour.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_very_friendly_06</key>
<string>So, the deal is done. Excellent! We march on in friendship, to the consternation of our rivals!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_very_friendly_07</key>
<string>Our rivals will tremble when they hear of this agreement, my friend! Excellent!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_very_friendly_08</key>
<string>How could I refuse such an offer from a friend such as you? I cannot!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_very_friendly_09</key>
<string>Ah, your diplomatic skills match your worth in friendship! We gladly accept.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_accept_very_friendly_10</key>
<string>Truly, my friend, your arguments have won the day! I accept your offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_accept</key>
<string>A most satisfactory end to our discussions. Our thanks. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_accept_02</key>
<string>This is a good end to an honourable meeting of warriors. My thanks for your sincerity.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_accept_03</key>
<string>A good ending for our talk, then. Diplomacy can, and has, achieved much!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_accept_04</key>
<string>We have an agreement then. Honourable men can always find a way.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_accept_05</key>
<string>Good. We are in agreement. Such is the way of the world when honest men speak.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_accept_06</key>
<string>Excellent. Your good sense does your clan credit.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_accept_07</key>
<string>Your skills as a diplomat do your clan much credit.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_accept_08</key>
<string>It is good to talk to a respectful and respected man, and to reach agreement in that fashion.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_accept_09</key>
<string>My thanks for your words, and for your agreement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_accept_10</key>
<string>My thanks for your wisdom, and for this agreement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_alliance</key>
<string>Our alliance is ended. The next time we meet may be with swords rather than tea cups.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_alliance_02</key>
<string>So our alliance is over. We are not enemies, perhaps, but we are no longer friends.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_alliance_03</key>
<string>Our alliance has served its purpose, and now we are done. There is little more to say.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_alliance_04</key>
<string>Sometimes the blossom falls on a still lake, and sometimes on a grave.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_alliance_05</key>
<string>All things have a season, and winter has come to our alliance. It is ended as you say.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_alliance_06</key>
<string>It will be as you say. Our alliance will no longer cause fear in our rivals.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_military_access</key>
<string>Very well, we will no longer march across your lands. We hope your safety will not suffer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_02</key>
<string>Very well. Our troops will have to march further. They will be toughened by the experience.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_03</key>
<string>I am sure you have your reasons for this refusal. I hope they are worth our inconvenience.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_04</key>
<string>This is an unfortunate day. Our troops much enjoyed the beauty of your lands. They will be saddened.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_05</key>
<string>I appreciate candour. It is honest to say that you no longer wish friends to visit.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_06</key>
<string>We will respect your decision. Our soldiers will be sad. They enjoyed many pleasures in your lands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_trade</key>
<string>Very well, you trade goods were not what our people wanted anyway. I am sure your cheap geegaws will sell elsewhere.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_trade_02</key>
<string>The trade was welcomed by our people, but so be it. Your merchants were largely unwashed and will not be missed.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_cancel_trade_03</key>
<string>Very well. Trade is not a fit subject for warriors to discuss anyway. It is over.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_accept</key>
<string>There is much wisdom in your decision, and in your long deliberations. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_accept_02</key>
<string>Careful deliberation has brought welcome agreement after all.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_accept_03</key>
<string>It is good to reach an accord. Let us hope it does not melt away like winter's snows.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_accept_04</key>
<string>We have talked long, and discussed many things. In the end, wisdom has prevailed, as it should.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_accept_05</key>
<string>So we are agreed, then. Your final offer has brought us to a good conclusion.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_accept_06</key>
<string>We accept. Your offer is not what we looked for, but it is an acceptable arrangement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_reject</key>
<string>It seems little is pleasing to you, then. Our talks must now conclude.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_reject_02</key>
<string>This is unfortunate. And I have known fish-wives make up their minds with more despatch!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_reject_03</key>
<string>So we have failed to reach accord. This is honest, at least.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_reject_04</key>
<string>We have talked, and know each others' hearts better. For now then, we go our separate ways.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_reject_05</key>
<string>So we have failed. Much talking has done little, save allow the tea to grow cold.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_counter_reject_06</key>
<string>So we are done, then. So much for talking. I warned my lord that this might be the outcomeâ€¦</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_hostage</key>
<string>A hostage. Yes. We will agree to such an arrangement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_hostage_02</key>
<string>Very well, we will give a home to one of your family. As long as treaties are honoured, of courseâ€¦</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_hostage_03</key>
<string>Your offer of a hostage shows a realistic grasp of ideas. This will do much to avoid unpleasantness.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_hostage_04</key>
<string>To give up one of your own shows much sincerity. It is a good thing.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_hostage_05</key>
<string>You recognise the reality of your position. Good. The hostage will be treated with respect.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_hostage_06</key>
<string>Very well. We will take a hostage, and you will remember that their life is in your hands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage</key>
<string>May this marriage further strengthen the bond between the clans.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_02</key>
<string>Marriage should be a time of happiness. Let this one increase the happiness and trust in both our lands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_03</key>
<string>A marriage is a sign of the sincerity in all our hearts. We agree.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_04</key>
<string>This marriage should do much to ease any difficulties between our clans.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_05</key>
<string>A marriage is a welcome sign of better times to come. I wish the couple much joy.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_marriage_06</key>
<string>Politics and the marriage bed: they are a start towards better things, I trust.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_reject</key>
<string>This is most unfortunate. I hope that you will have no cause to regret this decision.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_reject_02</key>
<string>Very well. I shall report your rejection. You are honest in your decision, and we respect that.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_reject_03</key>
<string>Your decision is a courageous one, but I will carry word of it to my clan.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_reject_04</key>
<string>Long have we talked, and with honesty. Your decision demonstrates sincerity.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_reject_05</key>
<string>So we cannot reach agreement. At least you have spoken with commendable honesty.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_reject_06</key>
<string>Very well. We finish on a note of disagreement. Sometimes such things are meant to be.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_state_gift</key>
<string>A proposal as straight and true as an arrow's shaft! My lord will accept. May good fortune favour us all.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_war</key>
<string>Ah! It is good to have open disagreement! We will put words aside: war it is!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_war_02</key>
<string>Good! I had grown weary of talking when there is work for proper men. I look forward to taking your life!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_war_03</key>
<string>War it is then. Many men will die because of the words spoken here.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_war_04</key>
<string>I hope you live long enough to recognise your foolishness, but not long after that.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_war_05</key>
<string>Your widows and orphans will soon be weeping at your foolishness today.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_war_06</key>
<string>So, you have decided to die in battle. We shall do our very best to give you an honourable death.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_war_07</key>
<string>Wives and children will curse your name for what you have decided to do today.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_war_08</key>
<string>War, then, is your decision. I trust you will be among the first to die!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_war_09</key>
<string>If we are to have war, then so be it. I look forward to saying prayers for your soul.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_acknowledge_war_10</key>
<string>So war has come. It is better this way. Japan will be better when you are safely dead.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_friendly</key>
<string>Please consider this offer carefully, so we may prosper together in friendship.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_friendly_02</key>
<string>Greetings, noble friend. I have come with a proposal from my lord that should also meet with your approval.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_friendly_03</key>
<string>My honoured friend, I bring a proposal that should meet with your approval.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_friendly_04</key>
<string>It is always an honour to speak with you, and I anticipate your wise agreement today.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_friendly_05</key>
<string>I have come with a proposal and, sure of your reasonable response, wish to put it to you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_friendly_06</key>
<string>Our greetings to you. In a spirit of friendship, we are keen to know your mind concerning this proposal.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_friendly_07</key>
<string>I come bearing friendly greetings, and a friendly proposal. Will you listen to my words?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_friendly_08</key>
<string>My duty here is born of friendship, my words of the perilous times we live in.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_friendly_09</key>
<string>I offer only further friendship, made plain in the words that I speak here today.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_friendly_10</key>
<string>It is good to speak with you, my friend. I have a proposal that may profit us both greatly!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_hostile</key>
<string>You would be wise to consider this offer, as the world is a hostile place to those without friends.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_hostile_02</key>
<string>A wise man would listen to my words. Of course, wisdom may be in short supply among your kind.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_hostile_03</key>
<string>My lord commands me to speak, and I obey, although I would sooner treat with ice-hearted demons.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_hostile_04</key>
<string>I speak to you today with reluctance. Try to listen carefully, and I will try to forget who you are.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_hostile_05</key>
<string>I am here to put a proposal to you, rather than take your head. Would that it were the latterâ€¦</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_hostile_06</key>
<string>Do you notice a peculiar smell? No? Ahâ€¦ I am here to put a proposal to you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_hostile_07</key>
<string>I would normally be happier treating with a leper, but I am ordered to put a proposal to youâ€¦</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_hostile_08</key>
<string>Is this the best you can do for an envoy? Pah! Very well, listen to my words, and think before you reply!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_hostile_09</key>
<string>I did not come here to bandy pleasantries. I came, as ordered, to make you an offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_hostile_10</key>
<string>You are known to be without honour, but these times make for strange meetings. Listen, then.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_neutral</key>
<string>Perhaps you could consider this offer: agreement between us could prove fruitful.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_neutral_02</key>
<string>I have come to make an open and honest offer. You will either accept it or not. What say you?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_neutral_03</key>
<string>I have a proposal. If you listen, you may profit. If you do not, well, we will not suffer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_neutral_04</key>
<string>I bear greetings, and a proposal. A wise man might listen to both.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_neutral_05</key>
<string>I come with greetings, and would know your mind on a matter of some importance.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_neutral_06</key>
<string>Greetings. I am sent today to carry a proposal to you and to carry away your hopefully wise response.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_neutral_07</key>
<string>My lord sends me to know your mind on some trifling matters. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_neutral_08</key>
<string>I am sent so that we may avoid unfortunate misunderstandings.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_neutral_09</key>
<string>My words today carry the weight of my lord's honour. Listen with care.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_neutral_10</key>
<string>My words are an offer from my lord's generous heart. Listen, and consider it with care.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_unfriendly</key>
<string>Let us speak together.  We will pretend that you are honest men, and deal with you as such.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_02</key>
<string>Let us speak briefly, so that I may be gone. There is a peculiar smell around hereâ€¦</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_03</key>
<string>I will start with honesty: I would not choose to be here. But here I am, and I will speak.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_04</key>
<string>My lord sends greetings. In this he is too generous. He also sends a proposal. You should listen.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_05</key>
<string>I have come in search of wisdom in response to my lord's proposal. I hope this is not a vain exercise.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_06</key>
<string>I doubt that we can reach agreement with such as you, but I must try. Listen carefully.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_07</key>
<string>I will say what I must, and then listen to your reply. But no more than that.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_08</key>
<string>I speak on my lord's part. His honour is indeed deep, to send a proposal to such as you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_09</key>
<string>Despite your reputation, I have come with an offer. Listen, then, and consider.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_unfriendly_10</key>
<string>We have heard that you have-- native cunning. Perhaps this will serve in place of wisdom as you listen to my words.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_very_friendly</key>
<string>Let us speak together in honour and friendship, as honest men do.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_02</key>
<string>Recognising your worth, my lord sends greetings, and instructs me to make you an offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_03</key>
<string>It is always good to speak with friends, and for friends to do well by each other.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_04</key>
<string>When honest men speak together in open friendship, let their unworthy rivals cringe in fear!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_05</key>
<string>I bear greetings to you, noble friend. I am sent with a proposal I am sure will meet with your approval!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_06</key>
<string>I am sent with a proposal that I think will be most pleasing to you, my friend. Listen, and decide for yourselfâ€¦</string>

<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_07</key>
<string>It is an honourable thing to speak with the honourable. I have come with a proposal for you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_08</key>
<string>I bear greetings, and my lord's offer. Perhaps you will listen with wisdom and friendship.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_09</key>
<string>My lord sends his best wishes, and hopes that we may reach further agreement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_approach_very_friendly_10</key>
<string>I am sure our talks today will be friendly and bring further harmony to our lives.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_cancel_alliance</key>
<string>In time, all friendships fade. The time has come to end our alliance.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_cancel_alliance_02</key>
<string>So then, we have come to the end of our way together. Let us part, and go our separate ways.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_cancel_alliance_03</key>
<string>Our alliance should now end. Not in bitterness, but simply because all things have a season.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_cancel_alliance_04</key>
<string>Every cherry blossom fades and falls. Our alliance has run its course. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_cancel_alliance_05</key>
<string>Our alliance must be considered over. The time has come to follow separate paths to glory.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_cancel_alliance_06</key>
<string>Our alliance no longer serves an honest purpose. It is ended.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_cancel_military_access</key>
<string>The spirits of our lands are unquiet. We can no longer allow your armies to disturb their tranquillity.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_cancel_military_access_02</key>
<string>Your troops disturb the peace of our people, and have few manners. It is time for them to leave our lands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_cancel_military_access_03</key>
<string>We can no longer let your troops wander where they will in our lands. There: it is said.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_cancel_trade</key>
<string>The time has come to put an end to trade between our peoples. It now serves no real purpose.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_cancel_trade_02</key>
<string>Regretfully, my lord must now forbid his merchants from trading with your merchants.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_cancel_trade_03</key>
<string>We no longer see a need for our merchants to trade with you, that is the sum of my message.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_counter_accept</key>
<string>We must accept, however heavy our hearts. Such is the path of life.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_counter_accept_02</key>
<string>Your words have merit, and I am sure my lord will approve. I accept your counter-proposal.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_counter_accept_03</key>
<string>You have spoken well, and I am persuaded. I will accept your offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_counter_accept_04</key>
<string>Your proposal has much to commend it. Yesâ€¦ Yes. We agree to your terms. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_counter_accept_05</key>
<string>Your words are wise. We accept your proposal gladly.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_counter_accept_06</key>
<string>Your proposed settlement is wise and fair. We accept.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_counter_reject</key>
<string>All our words have been wasted. Our talks have been barren: we cannot agree.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_counter_reject_02</key>
<string>Your words lack substance, and I will risk the wrath of heaven by rejecting them immediately.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_counter_reject_03</key>
<string>You have spoken poorly and done your clan no service today. I must reject your proposal.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_counter_reject_04</key>
<string>Your proposal was not what we wished to hear. I cannot, in all truth, accept it.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_counter_reject_05</key>
<string>Your words have been without number, but also without wisdom. We cannot accept your offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_counter_reject_06</key>
<string>Your proposal is interesting, but it would be unwise for us to accept it.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_hostage</key>
<string>Trust can be earned: if your family provides a hostage, further unpleasantness can be avoided.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_hostage_02</key>
<string>A member of your family would, I think, make a most excellent guarantee against future misunderstandings.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_hostage_03</key>
<string>Today, I suggest this: give us a hostage, that we can know your behaviour is honest.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_hostage_04</key>
<string>I will speak simply and clearly: we require a hostage, so that your actions will not be unwise.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_hostage_05</key>
<string>We require a guarantee of your future prudence. One of your own, as a hostage, would be adequate.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_hostage_06</key>
<string>We must be prudent, and have some guarantee of your behaviour. We need a hostage.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_military_access</key>
<string>It would demonstrate wisdom and strength if you allowed our armies passage.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_military_access_02</key>
<string>Our armies march where they will, but there is nothing wrong with asking, politely, if they may enter your lands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_military_access_03</key>
<string>It would show wisdom and self-confidence if you allowed our armies to march across your lands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_player_must_become_vassal</key>
<string>It is time to show your inner strength, and recognise truth: you cannot go on alone. Now is the time to accept you must be our vassal.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_player_must_become_vassal_02</key>
<string>I will be plain: your future is bleak without a protector. Become a vassal of my lord, and secure your well-being.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_player_must_become_vassal_03</key>
<string>Understand this: times are changing, and you would be well advised to seek a protector. We could be your protectors.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_regular_payment</key>
<string>It would, perhaps, show your wisdom if you gave us gold. Repeated gifts would surely further illustrate your prudence.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_regular_payment_02</key>
<string>Trifling regular contributions to our treasury would significantly increase the respect for you that we hold in our hearts.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_regular_payment_03</key>
<string>I am sure that you will understand the wisdom of making regular &quot;contributions&quot; to our treasuryâ€¦</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_single_payment</key>
<string>A gift of gold would prove your wise generosity and ensure the security of your lands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_single_payment_02</key>
<string>I hesitate to mention it, but a gift of gold - a substantial gift - would do much to ease tensions between us.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_demand_single_payment_03</key>
<string>I will speak plainly: you have it within your grasp to gain our favourable opinion. It will cost you only a modest amount of gold.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_offer_demand</key>
<string>We should discuss matters of mutual interest, so that all may profit and flourish as a result.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_offer_demand_02</key>
<string>Let us speak, like sensible men, of many things, and so reach some accord here today.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_offer_demand_03</key>
<string>We should speak openly of matters that concern us both, and so avoid unfortunate misunderstanding.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_offer_demand_04</key>
<string>Let us speak, then, of matters of import. I have a proposal to make.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_offer_demand_05</key>
<string>Consider this, our offer, and do so with all your undoubted wisdom.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_offer_demand_06</key>
<string>Consider my words with care, and likewise your response.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_offer_demand_07</key>
<string>Consider my offer, and see the deeper harmony that it brings to the world.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_offer_demand_08</key>
<string>I would have you listen to my offer. You may find it interesting.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_offer_demand_09</key>
<string>Perhaps, if you listen to my offer, you will find some merit in the idea.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_offer_demand_10</key>
<string>When you consider my offer, do not consider only the blossom. Look to the whole tree.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_1</key>
<string>My heart is heavy. Such an offer cannot be accepted.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_1_02</key>
<string>On my lord's behalf, I will decline this offer. I will not trouble him with the decision.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_1_03</key>
<string>I am sure your offer is sincere, and so my rejection must be equally sincere.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_1_04</key>
<string>Our talk has been interesting but we cannot agree to anything at this time. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_1_05</key>
<string>I have considered your words. I must tell you that your proposal is rejected.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_1_06</key>
<string>Your offer is not acceptable, in principle or in detail. My apologies for such bluntness.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_1_07</key>
<string>Your offer does little for my clan. Our harmony would be lessened by accepting.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_1_08</key>
<string>Your words are indeed persuasive, but not quite enough to sway my heart and mind.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_1_09</key>
<string>Some blossoms are treasured and remembered forever. Others simply fall. Your offer is one of the latter.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_1_10</key>
<string>I am saddened that I must refuse your offer. I had hoped for agreement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_2</key>
<string>Your offer is worthy, but that does not make it acceptable.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_2_02</key>
<string>Such an offer would not be acceptable to my lord. I will not bring the matter to his attention.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_2_03</key>
<string>This proposal is quite interesting, but it is not right for me to accept it at this time.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_2_04</key>
<string>Our talk has been largelyâ€¦ pointless. I will not say wasted, even though it ends with no agreement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_2_05</key>
<string>I will speak plainly. You offer is not acceptable. Our response, then, is a simple &quot;no&quot;.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_2_06</key>
<string>I do not need to think on your words for long. No. Your offer is not what we want.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_2_07</key>
<string>This offer is interesting but, in honesty, I cannot accept it.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_2_08</key>
<string>Perhaps I am at fault, but I do not think your offer is acceptable.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_2_09</key>
<string>I will speak in plain, soldier's terms: I do not accept your proposal.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_2_10</key>
<string>Ah! The blossom withers on the tree. I cannot agree to this.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1</key>
<string>This offer would be an affront to a mountain monkey. Bah!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_02</key>
<string>Such words would normally cost you your head. Be grateful for my restraint.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_03</key>
<string>This proposal is quite interesting, but only in the way that a dunghill is interesting. So, no.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_04</key>
<string>All your words disguised only an insult to our clan, not a sincere offer. And insulted, we refuse you anything.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_05</key>
<string>You must think us simple. I will not bother to dignify your offer with anything except a &quot;no&quot;.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_06</key>
<string>So you think us no better than fools. I reject your offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_07</key>
<string>Your words are an insult to our honour! Oh! I yearn to cut off your arrogant head!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_08</key>
<string>Is this some kind of joke that only dishonourable men laugh about? Your offer is worthless!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_09</key>
<string>You think me simple, then. Well, I reject your proposal, and your arrogant idiocy!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_1_10</key>
<string>I will not stain my sword with the blood of a fool! That is all that keeps you alive!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_2</key>
<string>We may be honest folk, but we are not to be treated as fools! This is completely outrageous!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_2_02</key>
<string>Ha! You jest then. Your humour is poor indeed, as I would expect from the uncouth.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_2_03</key>
<string>You are a brave man to make such a proposal. Brave, or touched by madness.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_2_04</key>
<string>Your talk was no more than the tittle-tattle of peasantry. Your offer insults my intelligence.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_2_05</key>
<string>My swordarm aches with the strain of not taking your head. No, no, no. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_2_06</key>
<string>Truly, your clan is touched with foolishness if you thought such an offer could ever be acceptable.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_2_07</key>
<string>Have you taken a blow to the head recently? No? Ah, then you are a naturally born idiot!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_2_08</key>
<string>Surely you do not expect such a silly, womanish, insulting proposal to be accepted?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_2_09</key>
<string>You are a fool. Nothing else explains why you would make such an offer. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_generic_reject_angry_2_10</key>
<string>Your father must know little but disappointment in his children. No. You offer is foolish.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_not_interested_in_further_discussion</key>
<string>Your words are clouds on the wind: pretty, but soon gone. Further talk is pointless now.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_not_interested_in_further_discussion_02</key>
<string>We have talked and talked, and decided nothing, save that these talks are now concluded.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_not_interested_in_further_discussion_03</key>
<string>I grow weary with talk. Perhaps on another occasion we may speak with better results.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_not_interested_in_further_discussion_04</key>
<string>Your talk wearies me. Perhaps after a few months of rest I might feel like listening again.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_not_interested_in_further_discussion_05</key>
<string>The day grows old, and I would be at supper. We have talked enough.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_not_interested_in_further_discussion_06</key>
<string>Enough of talk! It is obvious that, for now, we cannot reach agreement.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_not_interested_in_further_discussion_07</key>
<string>We have talked the day away. We will not agree, and an end to discussions seems a wise move.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_not_interested_in_further_discussion_08</key>
<string>We have talked too long! Anyone would think us peasant women, bartering over fish! Enough!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_not_interested_in_further_discussion_09</key>
<string>My mind is dulled with words. We will stop now.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_not_interested_in_further_discussion_10</key>
<string>Even the chattering tengu eventually stops talking! We should do the same, and end our discussion.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_demand_alliance</key>
<string>We have thought deeply. Do you not think that our enemies would shake with fear if we were openly allied?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_demand_alliance_02</key>
<string>Can you not see it? Our enemies would die of fear alone if we were allies! It would be glorious!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_demand_alliance_03</key>
<string>I offer an alliance! Think of the glory that could be ours, and accept this proposal!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_demand_peace</key>
<string>Enough brave men have died. It is time to discuss an end to the fighting.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_demand_peace_02</key>
<string>An honourable peace. That is all I offer. It is a good offer, honestly made.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_demand_peace_03</key>
<string>I offer this: peace, a simple end to war before our peoples are gone, like blossom on the breeze.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_demand_trade</key>
<string>Trade would surely bring benefits to both our clans.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_demand_trade_02</key>
<string>Trade is beneath a warrior's dignity, but allowing our merchants to work would be sensible.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_demand_trade_03</key>
<string>Townsmen have their uses, but only when they are allowed to trade. What say you?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_marriage</key>
<string>We offer a marriage. Let this be a sign of better times to come.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_marriage_02</key>
<string>A marriage between our families would benefit us all, for it would be a sign of trust between us.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_marriage_03</key>
<string>I suggest a suitable marriage is possible. It would do much to improve attitudes on both sides.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_marriage_04</key>
<string>There is merit in one idea, that could bind us closer: what say you to an arranged marriage?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_marriage_05</key>
<string>Perhaps you would consider a marriage between our clans. Such a thing would do much to foster good relations.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_marriage_06</key>
<string>I propose a marriage. It is a simple thing, an honest thing, and could do much good for us all.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_regular_payment</key>
<string>Please accept our gifts: they reflect your honour and worth.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_regular_payment_02</key>
<string>I offer you a regular stipend, paid directly into your lord's treasury.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_regular_payment_03</key>
<string>A gift is always welcome, so let our repeated gifts to you be doubly, even triply, welcome!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_single_payment</key>
<string>Please accept this gift. It is a mark of the esteem in which you are held.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_single_payment_02</key>
<string>I can offer you a substantial sum, in the hope it will achieve a better understanding between us.</string>

<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_offer_single_payment_03</key>
<string>Perhaps a substantial amount of money might help you to understand that we are your friends.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_friendly</key>
<string>Welcome, noble friend! There is much to discuss for our mutual benefit!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_friendly_02</key>
<string>Greetings! It is always good to see honest friends, come to take tea and talk of many things.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_friendly_03</key>
<string>There is always a welcome for you, and a receptive audience for your ideas.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_friendly_04</key>
<string>A friend is always welcome, especially in these times of trouble. Come, let us talk.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_friendly_05</key>
<string>So, my friend, of what do you wish to talk?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_friendly_06</key>
<string>My friend, welcome. Come, speak your wisdom, and I will give your words due consideration.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_friendly_07</key>
<string>Welcome. Be seated, and tell me of the concerns that bring you here.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_friendly_08</key>
<string>Let me listen to your offer, and answer as best I may.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_friendly_09</key>
<string>Speak, and I will listen. If I can help, I will try to do so.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_friendly_10</key>
<string>In a spirit of friendship, speak of your terms, and I will answer presently.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_hostile</key>
<string>Speak carefully, for my sword is ready to take your head!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_hostile_02</key>
<string>So then, what have you to say today? Will my ears be shamed by the hearing?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_hostile_03</key>
<string>Speak if you must, but speak carefully if you value your tongue.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_hostile_04</key>
<string>I have better things to do than listen to an old woman's prattle. Speak, and try to make sense!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_hostile_05</key>
<string>You are here like an honest man at the front gate. Better that, I suppose, than an assassin over the wall.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_hostile_06</key>
<string>Speak plainly. Speak quickly. Your presence is not entirely welcome. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_hostile_07</key>
<string>Do not expect tea. That is for friends. Speak your piece.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_hostile_08</key>
<string>I do not wish to listen to you, but politics makes for strange and sometimes unwelcome encounters.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_hostile_09</key>
<string>Speak your insolence, then I will reply.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_hostile_10</key>
<string>I did not think you had the courage to come before me, but speak now that you are here.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_neutral</key>
<string>Welcome! I am here to listen and to seek a worthy outcome to our discussions.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_neutral_02</key>
<string>An unexpected meeting may, with hindsight, turn out to be welcome. Let us see what happens here.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_neutral_03</key>
<string>Sometimes travellers meet, and profit by it. Shall we see what our journeys have in store for us?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_neutral_04</key>
<string>Well, I will listen to your words for a time. Do not waste this chance I give to you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_neutral_05</key>
<string>Speak, and do not mumble. Honesty and clarity march forwards together in negotiations.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_neutral_06</key>
<string>I will listen attentively, and then give you a fair response. Now, speak your part.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_neutral_07</key>
<string>Please, speak honestly, and I will give you good attention.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_neutral_08</key>
<string>Let us hope that today ends well. Now, speak of your wishes and intentions.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_neutral_09</key>
<string>I am here to listen. When you have spoken, and spoken in honesty, I will give a proper response.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_neutral_10</key>
<string>I will listen, as politeness dictates. As to the response you receive: that depends on what you offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_unfriendly</key>
<string>Time and honour are both being wasted. What do you want?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_unfriendly_02</key>
<string>I have weapons that need polishing. Speak quickly, so that I may be about something useful today.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_unfriendly_03</key>
<string>When a tiger growls at your door you listen, but you do not invite it to take tea. Speak.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_unfriendly_04</key>
<string>Speak your pretty speech, but do not imagine for one moment that words alone will sway our opinions.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_unfriendly_05</key>
<string>I will listen, but my heart tells me that your words may not be entirely helpful to our cause.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_unfriendly_06</key>
<string>Speak, then, and do so with despatch. I have other pressing business with my stewards.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_unfriendly_07</key>
<string>I will listen to what you say, but it had better be good!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_unfriendly_08</key>
<string>Say what you must, but my heart tells me not to listen with hope.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_unfriendly_09</key>
<string>I will hear your words, although I do not expect to profit from them.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_unfriendly_10</key>
<string>Cast your words upon the breeze. Perhaps they will drift past my ears.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_very_friendly</key>
<string>Welcome indeed, my honourable friend! What shall we discuss, in the hope of mutual profit?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_very_friendly_02</key>
<string>Come, let us take tea and talk. Then, after we have agreed, what other pleasures will we enjoy?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_very_friendly_03</key>
<string>Be welcome, my friend. I have ordered sake prepared to whet our wits and warm our hearts.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_very_friendly_04</key>
<string>This is a good day! A friendly visit! Good conversation! And perhaps a profitable outcome for all?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_very_friendly_05</key>
<string>It is good to see a friendly face. Come, let us talk, and take tea perhaps.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_very_friendly_06</key>
<string>I am honoured to receive you. It is always a good day when friends come to talk.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_very_friendly_07</key>
<string>Come, be seated. I will order tea, and we will have agreement before sunset!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_very_friendly_08</key>
<string>My good friend! Tell me what concerns you, and together we will resolve your problems!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_very_friendly_09</key>
<string>Meetings with friends are always a pleasant diversion. What has brought you here today?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_receive_very_friendly_10</key>
<string>My friend, I am ready to listen to your every word. What I can do for you, I will do for you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_hostage</key>
<string>Our flesh and blood are not traded like cattle! There will be no hostage!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_hostage_02</key>
<string>No. No. No. Our sons and daughters would die of shame if housed in your hovels.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_hostage_03</key>
<string>I do not think so. It is well known that you can barely bring up your own whelps, let alone look after the children of others!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_hostage_04</key>
<string>Do not be a fool. Why would I trust a child of ours near the beasts in your household?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_hostage_05</key>
<string>A hostage? You think our situation that bad? Well, it is not. You cannot have a hostage!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_hostage_06</key>
<string>I would sooner cut off my swordarm and give you that than see you take a hostage!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_marriage</key>
<string>I must tell you that our clan would sooner have the lowest leatherworker as a marriage partner! So: no.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_marriage_02</key>
<string>This is unacceptable. For a start, it is well known that your people are not blessed by a surfeit of good looks.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_marriage_03</key>
<string>Why on earth would we want to marry into a family of pigs?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_marriage_04</key>
<string>A kind offer, but I am sure we wanted our children to marry someone - well, cleaner for a start!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_marriage_05</key>
<string>What spirit of madness makes you suggest such a thing? Your mind and soul are truly ill.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_marriage_06</key>
<string>Ha! Never. My lord's children will marry dung collectors before they consider any of your whelps!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_military_access</key>
<string>You must think we are stupid, or blind. Your armies will never pollute our lands!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_military_access_02</key>
<string>Such a thing will never happen! March elsewhere-- to Hell, preferably-- but not into our lands!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_military_access_03</key>
<string>No! The very stones of our land would hurl themselves at your unwashed and uncouth soldiers!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_protectorate</key>
<string>There is no honour in your offer. There is little honour in you. We will never be your slaves!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_protectorate_02</key>
<string>Expecting us to lay bare our necks to your blade is insulting. This we will never do!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_protectorate_03</key>
<string>No, no, no. We are not so foolish as to let wild dogs guard our children.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment</key>
<string>Do you think us simple, or under the rule of moon rabbits? Why would we fill your treasury? No.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_02</key>
<string>If all the demons in Hell came to our gates they would not see a single coin from us, so why should you?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_03</key>
<string>You are a clan of leeches then, content to suck any lifeblood! It will not happen today. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_single_payment</key>
<string>Stuffing a pig's mouth once only makes it return for another meal. You will have no gold.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_02</key>
<string>Ah! You are a clan of merchants then! Well, my lord does not deal with merchants, or pay them without reason!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_03</key>
<string>A fool leaves meat outside his door in the hope the wolves will go away. You think us fools, then.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_demand_alliance</key>
<string>An alliance! I see foaming madness has not entirely left your clan, then! But, no.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_demand_alliance_02</key>
<string>I would sooner cast myself into the sea to be eaten by crabs than agree to an alliance with you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_demand_alliance_03</key>
<string>An alliance? A thousand years of laughter are not enough for that idea!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace</key>
<string>Peace? Are you so tired and womanly that you need peace? Bah! No!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_02</key>
<string>Peace? We shall have peace when you are in the grave, and not a moment before!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_03</key>
<string>Peace is not for the likes of you. Peace is for honourable, honest men. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_04</key>
<string>You may want peace, Heaven may want peace. But the land will have peace when your corpses feed the crows!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_05</key>
<string>Peace will not come while your heart beats! </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_06</key>
<string>Peace! With you and yours? Never, as long as I can draw a sword and ride a horse!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade</key>
<string>No. We will not trade. I doubt that even foreign devils would willingly trade with your kind. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_02</key>
<string>Why would we want anything that you or your unwashed kind have touched? There will be no trade!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_03</key>
<string>Trade? Trade? No warrior speaks of trade! And with the likes of you? Even merchants go elsewhere!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment</key>
<string>So! You think us whores, then, to be bought by your gold. No, that is not the way of things. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_02</key>
<string>You may measure honour in gold, but we do not. We are not your servants, paid to do your bidding.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_03</key>
<string>We will not be paid off like common labourers! We still have honour!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_single_payment</key>
<string>Do not presume so much! Your gold is dishonourable, and we will not take it.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_02</key>
<string>Your money would be a stain on our honour, and we will not take it.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_03</key>
<string>Your money? No. The stolen wealth of others is best returned to its rightful owners!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_hostage</key>
<string>A hostage? No. Some arrangements are not acceptable.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_hostage_02</key>
<string>We do not give our children over to the likes of you. Ever.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_hostage_03</key>
<string>A hostage? No. You will have no one, no beast, no rock, not even a grain of rice to hold.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_marriage</key>
<string>Unfortunately, marriage to one of your, ah, brood would not be appropriate.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_marriage_02</key>
<string>I can answer this immediately: a marriage between our families would not be appropriate.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_marriage_03</key>
<string>I will answer: no. Our sons and daughters are not traded for petty advantage with you.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_marriage_04</key>
<string>A marriage, you say? Perhaps not. I fear none of our eligible youngsters would be entirely happy with the idea.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_marriage_05</key>
<string>I must respectfully decline the offer. Marriage to one of your family does not sit well with our plans.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_marriage_06</key>
<string>I do not think a suitable partner could be found, so: no.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_military_access</key>
<string>No. Our lands would be dishonoured by your heavy tread. The spirits would be much disturbed.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_military_access_02</key>
<string>Sadly, I do not think my lord would want his peace disturbed by the marching of your men.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_military_access_03</key>
<string>No. Your troops would shatter the harmony of our lands, just by their presence!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_military_access_04</key>
<string>You wish to march across our lands? I do not think so. Soldiers do not always depart after they arrive.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_military_access_05</key>
<string>Your troops would frighten peasants and make them stop work, so you cannot march across our lands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_military_access_06</key>
<string>I can see no sensible reason why you need to do that. You cannot march where you will.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_protectorate</key>
<string>The open hand of friendship can quickly grasp the sword of oppression: we must refuse your offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_protectorate_02</key>
<string>No, we cannot. The friend who will not leave is soon regarded as no friend at all.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_protectorate_03</key>
<string>Sadly, we must decline the honour of sheltering behind your warriors. We have weapons of our own.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_regular_payment</key>
<string>You are mistaken: we are not cheap merchants to be taxed by you!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_regular_payment_02</key>
<string>I had not realised you were short of money, but we cannot help.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_regular_payment_03</key>
<string>Ah! So you are brigands then, demanding money! Hmm. Brigands are crucified in our lands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_single_payment</key>
<string>Gold given dishonourably would not bring you honour. We cannot do this.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_single_payment_02</key>
<string>We will not pay you. Perhaps if you curb your expenditures, all will be well with your treasury.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_demand_single_payment_03</key>
<string>No. Remember, the squirrel that saves for winter does not need to beg for food.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_alliance</key>
<string>An alliance would not bring honour to you or us at this time.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_alliance_02</key>
<string>I do not think an alliance with you would be in everyone's best interests at this time.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_alliance_03</key>
<string>An alliance? It is interesting that you think that way, but we do not.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_alliance_04</key>
<string>No, no. An alliance with you would be entirely unthinkable... unsuitableâ€¦ unâ€¦ unâ€¦ unbecoming.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_alliance_05</key>
<string>While an alliance is undoubtedly in your interests, I judge it not to be so for us.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_alliance_06</key>
<string>With all possible respect: no. We will not be allies.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_hostage</key>
<string>No. Our children are not bred so that they may be sent away to learn common manners from strangers.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>

<string>Sadly, none of our children would be suitable to be part of your household.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_hostage_03</key>
<string>I am afraid I must refuse. Our children are not rice sacks to be shipped hither and thither.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_hostage_04</key>
<string>A hostage, is that what you ask. Well, you cannot have one. There, it is said.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_hostage_05</key>
<string>I will not countenance such an act. You cannot have a hostage.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_hostage_06</key>
<string>I will not agree to giving up one of our own to your tender care.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_peace</key>
<string>Peace? You talk of peace? This is not a time of peace, but of war!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_peace_02</key>
<string>Peace is indeed a thing to be cherished, but not just yet.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_peace_03</key>
<string>We shall have peace, but not today. Perhaps in a hundred years, or when we are all dead. But not now.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_peace_04</key>
<string>The war goes on. There can be no peace with you. Why should we want it?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_peace_05</key>
<string>Peace is difficult to grasp when one's hands are slippery with blood.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_peace_06</key>
<string>There can be no peace. Not yet. I do not say &quot;never&quot;, but I do say &quot;not now&quot;.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_trade</key>
<string>We cannot do this: you have nothing that our people could possibly desire.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_trade_02</key>
<string>Trade with your merchants might well offend our merchants, so we decline your offer.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_trade_03</key>
<string>No. Our townsfolk are, sadly, quite set in their ways, and unlikely to buy your shoddy goods.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_trade_04</key>
<string>I have seen your lands' goods. I have heard of your markets. We want nothing of either.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_trade_05</key>
<string>I have heard that your goods are not of the finest quality. So, no, there will be no trade.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_demand_trade_06</key>
<string>Perhaps trade would benefit you, but it is not in our interests at the moment.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_hostage</key>
<string>You offer a hostage? Have you anything of true value instead?</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_hostage_02</key>
<string>One of yours as a hostage? Is it housetrained? I think not, on balance.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_hostage_03</key>
<string>No, I do not think we want anyone from your family in our house.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_marriage</key>
<string>A generous and sincere offer, but matters must be otherwise.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_marriage_02</key>
<string>An arranged marriage. I do not think this would work. My lord is quite particular about his relatives.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_marriage_03</key>
<string>I do not think this is appropriate. Marriages work best when they are between equals.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_marriage_04</key>
<string>A marriage offer? Now there is an interesting idea, but a completely impractical one. No.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_marriage_05</key>
<string>While such a marriage would undoubtedly reflect well on your clan, it is not suitable.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_marriage_06</key>
<string>No. I think not. We prefer that our children marry well.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_regular_payment</key>
<string>We are not merchants or tradesmen, to be bought in this fashion. We are warriors!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_regular_payment_02</key>
<string>No. I do not think my lord would accept payment, like some tradesman. </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_regular_payment_03</key>
<string>While gold has its uses, paying us off like common brigands is not one of them.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_regular_payment_04</key>
<string>We do not care to be thought of as cheap ashigaru, to be bought off for a handful of coins.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_regular_payment_05</key>
<string>We will not be your kept women, paid off in coin to suit your whims.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_regular_payment_06</key>
<string>Ah! You mistake us for men of greed, not honour. We will not take your money.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_single_payment</key>
<string>Gold does not buy our honour.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_single_payment_02</key>
<string>Nothing of ours is for sale.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_single_payment_03</key>
<string>No. Your gold would be better spent on buying a lesson in good manners.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_single_payment_04</key>
<string>A magnificent sum, to be sure, but my lord prizes his honour above all monetary gain.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_single_payment_05</key>
<string>Our honour does not have a price. Yoursâ€¦ may have.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_reject_offer_single_payment_06</key>
<string>Within your breasts beat the hearts of merchants, not warriors. But you cannot buy us.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_too_many_counters</key>
<string>You have offered much, but with little sense to your proposals. We have no more time now.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_too_many_counters_02</key>
<string>You have talked and talked, and now it is my turn: no. To all your proposals.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_too_many_counters_03</key>
<string>I have listened patiently, so I will be brief now: no, no and no. Your thoughts have no clarity.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_too_many_counters_04</key>
<string>And now I have listened for long enough. You have talked and talked, and said very little of worth. We are done.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_too_many_counters_05</key>
<string>Your arguments have been weak and confused, your offers likewise, and I am finished here.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_too_many_counters_06</key>
<string>It is time to end these discussions. You have talked and talked, but without real meaning. We are done.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_war</key>
<string>War it is, then. Now you will feel the tiger's claws!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>

<string>We are at war. Good! An honest battle is always better than polite chit-chat!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_war_03</key>
<string>We are done with talk. The next time we meet the clash of swords will be our eloquent arguments.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_war_04</key>
<string>Today the talking ends. Words will be stillborn in your dead mouth. There is war between us.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_war_05</key>
<string>Talking is done. The sword is now drawn. We will have war!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_war_06</key>
<string>The time for meaningless talk is done! The time for action is upon us. War has come!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_war_07</key>
<string>I say this: say your farewells. Death is coming. We are now at war.</string>

<diplomacy_strings>

<string>Enough talk! War is now the only way. I wish you an honourable death!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>

<string>We are now at war. I say one thing more: die. Die soon. Die at our hands.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>japanese_generic_monarchy_war_10</key>
<string>We are at war, and there is an end to our talk. You may go now, and prepare your soul.</string>

<string>Very well, our clans will be blown by different winds. </string>

<string>Good. War is a worthy pursuit for Mori men, even against such as you.</string>

<string>The tide and winds have changed. We can no longer be allies.</string>

</diplomacy_strings>

<string>You must think us simple fisherfolk, to ask such a thing. We Mori are not noted for our even tempers.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>mori_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade</key>
<string>We Mori have better things to do than act as your shipping agents! </string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>mori_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment</key>
<string>And fools call us pirates! We will not do this!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>

<string>Ha! Mori gold is not surrendered to passing bandits! Do not expect riches here.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>
<diplomacy_strings>
<key>mori_reject_offer_demand_peace</key>
<string>You are wise to seek peace, but unfortunate in seeking it from us. We Mori see no need for peace.</string>

<string>That particular ship will remain unlaunched.</string>

<string>You would be wise to listen, for our generals ache to send you a different message!</string>
</diplomacy_strings>

<string>We must ask you not to send your armies across Oda lands. Their presence interferes in the work of our own glorious generals.</string>

<string>Our ancestors are undoubted concerned, but we agree.</string>
</diplomacy_strings>

<string>Our warriors are not yet so weak that we must give in to your demands.</string>

<string>Our generals would rightly question such a state of affairs.</string>
